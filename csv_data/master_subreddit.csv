Time comes to ""sign my receipt"" - and a TIP line appears. I grab the pen. 
Sign my name.
He looks up at me like he did something wrong.
Nope. Just done tipping. 

See, it's getting out of hand. As a broke college student, these places are my kitchens. And if I had the means to eat out at restaraunts all the time I would. Many times $9-10 gets you further there than at a fast food place. But as someone who believes in tipping for good service (20-25%), I know I can't afford restaraunts.

Yet, recently I've noticed a progression of fast food/sandwich shops/take-out chains that think merely paying for the food you eat is not enough. Whether it's Jersey Mikes, Taco Del Mar, Panera, Quiznos, or any other place whos business model does not involve going above-and-beyond making/handing customers food - I don't care. I'm just done tipping. I tipped $2 yesterday, $4 the day before (lunch and dinner), and by the time I'm done I could have upgraded my internet speed. 
I know I'm not alone on this.


And I don't buy the ""it's the new POS systems"" line. They can change it if they wanted to. Also, the ""they only make minimum wage"" is bs too. I live in the Seattle area and the minimum wage is $13-15hr...

to make a burrito. Or a sandwich. Or hand me a coffee and a muffin.

And for those great employees who make it an enjoyable experience, I wish I could show my gratitude. I show your company gratitude by coming back. 

But for now, your companies have chosen to shame customers like me into paying for your wages. And I'm sorry, but I'm making a mental checklist of every place that pulls that crap. And I'm not going back.

Cause I'm done.

The drive-thru line was pretty long so we decided to go in and get food to go (since the dining area was closed due to the Coronavirus stuff). When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a nice young lady behind the counter. We ordered a 3pc chicken strip meal and a Deluxe sandwich meal. All the employees were very nice and polite. We moved off to the side so others could order while we waited on our food. A very short time later, the manager brought us our food, apologized for the wait (which wasn't at all long) and mentioned that he made it a 4pc meal for our patience. Definitely a bright spot in our day, and everything we had heard about Chick-Fil-A was confirmed in our first visit. Definitely a step above any fast-food chain in our area.

koje2k,fastfood,One of the positive aspects of the pandemic is that fast food restaurants have learned how to accommodate mobile ordering.,"I had been using mobile apps to place orders for at least a year prior to COVID, and at the time, it seemed like *at least* 20% of those restaurants had no idea how to process it. Sometimes it seemed like they genuinely had *no idea what a mobile order even was*.

Once the pandemic started affecting how people ordered fast food, everything changed. I never get confused looks from the cashiers or watch them scramble to figure out how to ring it up. The process is usually smooth, and I really hope that mobile ordering remains a popular way of doing business in the industry.

*That said...* 

The main reason I use mobile ordering right now is so that I don't have to go into the building or touch cash. I want to protect myself *and* the employees.

Yet as of a few weeks ago, half the restaurants around me have instituted “no drive thru mobile order” policies. Even if I select drive thru on the app order, I’m told “you have to park and come inside to pick up mobile orders” when I pull up to the speaker.

I’m not ordering customized stuff, or mountains of food that would hold up a non-existent line of cars. It’s essentially forcing me to share my germs via the air or surfaces (in a moment where the virus is out of control), and I’ve stopped going to those locations completely because of it.

> So what fast food customizations are folks doing at home?

Since most fast food is never spicy enough for me, I end up adding Tapatío or Sriracha to lots of stuff.

For salads I'll add fried onions or fried chilis, sunflower seeds or pepitas, chopped jalapeños or sliced pepperonis, salad seasoning, grated cheese, shredded Parmesan, etc. 

My Wendy's chili got some Frank's Red Hot today.

I usually add lime or lemon juice to my unsweetened tea.

Do any of you make your own dipping sauces? 

Are you adding anything to your sandwiches?

bfr6nx,fastfood,"Yippee! 40,000 subscribers for /r/FastFood!","A hearty welcome to both the new and old users. I hope all of you stick around. Please keep visiting, upvoting good links, commenting on posts, and submitting interesting articles to r/fastfood. 

The sub is now at 40,458 subscribers. It passed 40,000 users last Saturday (April 13th).

The sub has continued to see the increase in pageviews, unique pageviews, and subscriptions that I commented on when the sub hit 30,000 4 months ago. I think some of that has been because there has been an increase in the number of different users posting stuff to the sub, plus postings from more different news sources. I want to thank all the users who have been posting links to the sub.

----

I've been adding users as Approved Submitters who have regularly posted articles to /r/FastFood. It doesn't really change anything, at least for this sub. It's just an attaboy for a good post or comment — or in this case, multiple posts. 

To try to increase the diversity of fast food news sources (beyond the usual Chewboom, BrandEating, TheTakeout, etc.), I've also recently started awarding reddit silver for posts from websites that haven't been regularly posted to /r/FastFood.

To find more fast food articles you can use the [Google News fast food search](https://news.google.com/search?for=fast%20food) that's in the sidebar.

----

This reddit is only as good as the links and comments posted in the reddit. Please submit links to any interesting news articles that you find around the internet on fast food and fast casual restaurants.

I would especially like to see more links to information on smaller regional fast food chains and independent restaurants around the world, instead for the McDonalds, Burger Kings, Wendy's, and Taco Bells of the world. What sort of information would you like to see more of posted in r/fastfood?

----

To both the old and new members of the sub, I suggest that you review the sub's rules in the sidebar. This sub is a little more actively moderated than some subs on reddit, plus it uses automod to automatically remove many of the posts and comments that violate the sub's rules. But the general intent is to keep the discussions civil.

A reminder: Posting rules include — No insults, profanity, incivility, trolling, or bigotry. Nothing that is rude, vulgar or offensive. Nothing gross or disgusting.(https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/6v6fl9/a_reminder_posting_rules_include_no_insults/)

Plus: Don't modify article titles except to add a location in brackets unless the title is excessively misleading, vague, or clickbait-ish. Don't rely upon reddit's ""use suggested title"" feature.

There has been an increase in altered and editorialized titles the last few months.

For the last milestone post at 30,000 I wrote:

But on 19 March 2019 /r/FastFood did finally pass /r/TacoBell.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/b3jegq/rfastfood_has_finally_passed_rtacobell_in_the/

And so far the sub has stayed slightly ahead of /r/TacoBell in subscribers  where there are now at 40,355 tacos.

At the current rate of roughly 100 new subscribers/day, it'll take /r/FastFood around 300 days just to get where they are now. [Update: /r/Starbucks is now at 71,792 readers.]

wojok0,fastfood,I tried the Panda Express chicken strips,"You may have seen [the post the other day](https://www.chewboom.com/2022/08/11/panda-express-tests-new-hand-breaded-chicken-strips/) about them, they're testing it at Innovation Kitchen in Pasadena CA, which is where I happen to live, so I went in today to give it a try.

They're cooked to order so you get it fresh, alongside fresh fries. They were regular straight-cut fries like you'd get at a burger spot, not crinkle fries as in the photo. They were kinda like the fries at The Habit if you've ever had those.

They are definitely hand-breaded, as advertised. The breading is a bit coarser than your typical chicken strip. The breading itself has very little flavor, the chicken inside has a very mild flavor like it was marinated in saltwater maybe with a very few spices. 

They're a bit crispier than your average chicken strips and I'm afraid mine were ever so slightly overcooked. From a texture perspective, they do have a very satisfying crunch when you bite into them. There was no gristle or bad meat in any of my strips, it was all high quality chicken breast.

They have very little overall flavor, which doesn't make them bad, it just makes them kinda bland. I think they're relying on you getting the flavor from the sauces: A creamy sweet chili sauce and a hot habanero honey. And that leads to the flaw in my reporting:

I'm an absolute pepper baby. I can't handle even regular ol black pepper. On occasion, Panda's orange chicken can be too spicy for me to eat depending on how the batch is prepared. And I couldn't handle either of these sauces. I'm sure to an average palate they're delicious and flavorful, but I'm the wrong guy to be testing them. For that I apologize. I'll leave the sauces to someone else to review.

I ended up pairing the chicken strips with much milder sauces: a packet of McDonald's sweet & sour (which did NOT pair well, just was the wrong flavor to combine with this particular chicken strip) and a packet of Chick Fil A BBQ sauce (which was AMAZING with the Panda strips). 

It was 3 strips with fries for $7, or 4 strips with fries for $8. Might as well spend the extra dollar and get the 4th IMHO. These prices are fairly reasonable and approximately in line with the competition in this space. Although the serving of fries was smaller than most competitors. I was able to finish the whole plate and felt full by the end.


Overall, while they certainly weren't *bad,* they weren't extraordinary enough to make me go to Panda and order them over some of the other exceptional things on the menu. Panda's food is really good and I get cravings for their various specialties often. It's hard to recommend the chicken strips over anything else that Panda does SO WELL when Raising Cane's exists. 

I commend Panda for trying new things though. I just don't know if these would be a big enough seller to justify the extra labor cost in deploying them nationally.

a5kdfi,fastfood,"Wowza! 30,000 subscribers for /r/FastFood!","A hearty welcome to both the new and old users. I hope y'all stick around.

The sub is now at 30,125 subscribers, so it passed 30,000 users yesterday (Tuesday Dec 12) when there were 95 new members in one day.

The last three months has seen a moderate increase in pageviews, but an even bigger jump in unique pageviews (plus a jump in subscriptions). I think some of that has been that there has been an increase in different users posting to the sub, plus postings from more different news sources. I want to thank all the users who have been posting links to the sub.

But I'm not sure what happened this last week where the subscribers/day almost doubled during the week. Lots of students visiting /r/FastFood instead of studying for finals?

Whatever the reasons, welcome to /r/FastFood.

----

To both the old and new members of the sub, I suggest that you review the sub's rules in the sidebar. This sub is a little more actively moderated than some subs on reddit, plus it uses automod to automatically remove many of the posts and comments that violate the sub's rules. But the general intent is to keep the discussions civil.

 [A reminder: Posting rules include — No insults, profanity, incivility, trolling, or bigotry. Nothing that is rude, vulgar or offensive. Nothing gross or disgusting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/6v6fl9/a_reminder_posting_rules_include_no_insults/)

7 years ago when I became a mod the sub had been around for 3 years but only had 3 users.

The likely unobtainable goal: To have more members than /r/TacoBell, which currently has 32,982 tacos.

Basically you create an account at popeyes.com/offers and you can use them at restaurants. My location has sold out of sandwiches for a while so every time I go and they still dont have them I use one of these offers. I really like the 3pc tender, side and biscuit deal for $3.99 as it is super cheap. The 3pc tender combo comes with a drink and is $9.49 by me normally so this is basically half price. If you want more food they got the 5pc chicken or tenders, 2 sides and 2 biscuits for only $7.99. Two sides alone are $6 by me so this is fantastic as well.

I think my biggest score occurred at Taco Bell.  Sitting in the drive thru line for quite a while, maybe 20 minutes or, I eventually make it to the window.  The employee is apologetic, the wait didn’t really bother me too much since I was playing pogo on my phone, but after handing my order the lady hands me another bag.  This wonderful bag contained 6-8 random items.  Most of them were the value type items but it literally fed for me a day.

l78teo,fastfood,Tried the New Detroit-Style Pizza at Pizza Hut,"The new Detroit-Style Pizza is not good.

The new sauce they are using IS NOT good. It has an unpleasant flavor that I’m not able to describe, but it made the pizza very difficult to eat because of how much I did not like it. It was very bright and acidic, but there was a taste to it that was not enjoyable.

I got the double pepperoni and the small pepperoni cups were excellent. I have always been a supporter of the small pepperoni cups over normal pepperoni found at other pizza chains. They crisped up nicely in the oven and added great texture as well as flavor.

The crust, however, was disappointing. I am an avid lover of crispy cheese and I was excited for this pizza because of it, but unfortunately, there was a noticeable lack of crispy cheese around the crust of the pizza. The corner pieces were especially lacking. Of course, this could be because of the person who made my pizza, but it was disappointing nonetheless. The dough is just start Pizza Hut dough.

The rest of the pizza was what you expect from Pizza Hut. Same cheese, same quality of toppings, same dough. Would I get this pizza again? No, I would not. The sauce completely ruins the pizza in my opinion, and despite having said it took them 8 tries to perfect it on the blog, I think they need to do a better job",2021-01-28 21:05:26,2024-04-15 01:23:29.233057,1172 days 04:18:03.233057,85,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/l78teo/tried_the_new_detroitstyle_pizza_at_pizza_hut/

8scks4,fastfood,"Do you get double cheeseburgers, McDoubles, or double hamburgers at McDonald's? Is there a taste difference to you?","Hearing people talk about differences between double cheeseburgers and the McDouble got me thinking of why I order the way I do. Often, I buy doubles from McDonald's because they're tasty and economical. What I order depends on where I am that day. A McDonald's near me sells double hamburgers for $1.29, while another sells them for $1.59. The latter restaurant sells McDoubles for $1.29, so I'll buy those instead. Price differences sometimes matters, big or small. That lets me explore the different flavors of these sandwiches.

I know some people prefer one, and I respect that, but I'm a fan of all three. It just depends on either price (""Am I broke?"") or if I'm going to splurge on the extra cheese.

Taste can be a major factor. Noticeable taste differences between the double hamburger, double cheeseburger, and McDouble stem from how ingredients mingle with each other. Double hamburgers have a nice beefiness, where the seasonings and condiments compliment the meat well. In my opinion, the same is true with freshly-made Quarter Pound Hamburgers: the meat's juiciness is enhanced by the seasoning and mustard. 

McDoubles are a happy medium, because that piece of cheese melts nicely between patties. In addition, it doesn't overtake the beefiness or seasonings unless there's too much ketchup. Double cheeseburgers rely on cheese enhancing the sandwich. On double cheeseburgers, ketchup is noticeably messier because the top cheese blocks the meat from absorbing some of the condiments. Double cheeseburgers can be slightly greasier than either double hamburger or McDoubles.

These sandwiches are really simple--just a bun, some meat, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and seasoning--but it's really neat how 1, 2, or no cheese slices really impacts their flavor.

What do you think? Do you just order the same thing, or do you mix it up a little depending on price, allergies, whether you're in a cheesy mood, etc?",2018-06-19 21:17:33,2024-04-15 01:23:29.233078,2126 days 04:05:56.233079,66,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/8scks4/do_you_get_double_cheeseburgers_mcdoubles_or/

They have more of a beer-battered coating instead of traditional flour breading...think ""fish & chips"" but with chicken instead.

8e8lmv,fastfood,"I'm telling you right now, I'm not tipping at Taco Del Mar, Jersey Mikes, Panera, ect.","Just left Taco Del Mar. Had an enjoyable/average time picking out my burrito. Initiated some small talk. Guy was nice enough. 

Time comes to ""sign my receipt"" - and a TIP line appears. I grab the pen. 
Sign my name.
He looks up at me like he did something wrong.
Nope. Just done tipping. 

See, it's getting out of hand. As a broke college student, these places are my kitchens. And if I had the means to eat out at restaraunts all the time I would. Many times $9-10 gets you further there than at a fast food place. But as someone who believes in tipping for good service (20-25%), I know I can't afford restaraunts.

Yet, recently I've noticed a progression of fast food/sandwich shops/take-out chains that think merely paying for the food you eat is not enough. Whether it's Jersey Mikes, Taco Del Mar, Panera, Quiznos, or any other place whos business model does not involve going above-and-beyond making/handing customers food - I don't care. I'm just done tipping. I tipped $2 yesterday, $4 the day before (lunch and dinner), and by the time I'm done I could have upgraded my internet speed. 
I know I'm not alone on this.


And I don't buy the ""it's the new POS systems"" line. They can change it if they wanted to. Also, the ""they only make minimum wage"" is bs too. I live in the Seattle area and the minimum wage is $13-15hr...

to make a burrito. Or a sandwich. Or hand me a coffee and a muffin.

And for those great employees who make it an enjoyable experience, I wish I could show my gratitude. I show your company gratitude by coming back. 

But for now, your companies have chosen to shame customers like me into paying for your wages. And I'm sorry, but I'm making a mental checklist of every place that pulls that crap. And I'm not going back.

Cause I'm done.

I'm done.",2018-04-23 03:40:15,2024-04-08 22:47:43.162413,2177 days 19:07:28.162413,112,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/8e8lmv/im_telling_you_right_now_im_not_tipping_at_taco/

The drive-thru line was pretty long so we decided to go in and get food to go (since the dining area was closed due to the Coronavirus stuff). When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a nice young lady behind the counter. We ordered a 3pc chicken strip meal and a Deluxe sandwich meal. All the employees were very nice and polite. We moved off to the side so others could order while we waited on our food. A very short time later, the manager brought us our food, apologized for the wait (which wasn't at all long) and mentioned that he made it a 4pc meal for our patience. Definitely a bright spot in our day, and everything we had heard about Chick-Fil-A was confirmed in our first visit. Definitely a step above any fast-food chain in our area.

\-extra 1/4lb patty

\-extra onions, lettuce, tomato

\-add a slice of bacon

\-no mayo, no ketchup

\-add Mac Sauce

The total will come out to $8.10 BEFORE you use your mobile app coupon...after they scan it in, your total will come out to a measly $3.75.

I call it the ULTRA...I've got the local McD's around me to know about it (and workers now make them themselves for lunch!) after me ordering it enough times so I can just roll up to drive through and say ""I'll have THE ULTRA"" and I don't have to give them the details, it's awesome.

koje2k,fastfood,One of the positive aspects of the pandemic is that fast food restaurants have learned how to accommodate mobile ordering.,"I had been using mobile apps to place orders for at least a year prior to COVID, and at the time, it seemed like *at least* 20% of those restaurants had no idea how to process it. Sometimes it seemed like they genuinely had *no idea what a mobile order even was*.

Once the pandemic started affecting how people ordered fast food, everything changed. I never get confused looks from the cashiers or watch them scramble to figure out how to ring it up. The process is usually smooth, and I really hope that mobile ordering remains a popular way of doing business in the industry.

*That said...* 

The main reason I use mobile ordering right now is so that I don't have to go into the building or touch cash. I want to protect myself *and* the employees.

Yet as of a few weeks ago, half the restaurants around me have instituted “no drive thru mobile order” policies. Even if I select drive thru on the app order, I’m told “you have to park and come inside to pick up mobile orders” when I pull up to the speaker.

I’m not ordering customized stuff, or mountains of food that would hold up a non-existent line of cars. It’s essentially forcing me to share my germs via the air or surfaces (in a moment where the virus is out of control), and I’ve stopped going to those locations completely because of it.

kndom0,fastfood,At-home fast food customizations?,"Since everything is take-out or drive-thru these days, we're eating much of our fast food at home (except for the fries, onion rings, etc that get scarfed down on the way home). 

> So what fast food customizations are folks doing at home?

Since most fast food is never spicy enough for me, I end up adding Tapatío or Sriracha to lots of stuff.

For salads I'll add fried onions or fried chilis, sunflower seeds or pepitas, chopped jalapeños or sliced pepperonis, salad seasoning, grated cheese, shredded Parmesan, etc. 

My Wendy's chili got some Frank's Red Hot today.

I usually add lime or lemon juice to my unsweetened tea.

Do any of you make your own dipping sauces? 

Are you adding anything to your sandwiches?

The sub is now at 40,458 subscribers. It passed 40,000 users last Saturday (April 13th).

The sub has continued to see the increase in pageviews, unique pageviews, and subscriptions that I commented on when the sub hit 30,000 4 months ago. I think some of that has been because there has been an increase in the number of different users posting stuff to the sub, plus postings from more different news sources. I want to thank all the users who have been posting links to the sub.

----

I've been adding users as Approved Submitters who have regularly posted articles to /r/FastFood. It doesn't really change anything, at least for this sub. It's just an attaboy for a good post or comment — or in this case, multiple posts. 

To try to increase the diversity of fast food news sources (beyond the usual Chewboom, BrandEating, TheTakeout, etc.), I've also recently started awarding reddit silver for posts from websites that haven't been regularly posted to /r/FastFood.

To find more fast food articles you can use the [Google News fast food search](https://news.google.com/search?for=fast%20food) that's in the sidebar.

----

This reddit is only as good as the links and comments posted in the reddit. Please submit links to any interesting news articles that you find around the internet on fast food and fast casual restaurants.

I would especially like to see more links to information on smaller regional fast food chains and independent restaurants around the world, instead for the McDonalds, Burger Kings, Wendy's, and Taco Bells of the world. What sort of information would you like to see more of posted in r/fastfood?

----

To both the old and new members of the sub, I suggest that you review the sub's rules in the sidebar. This sub is a little more actively moderated than some subs on reddit, plus it uses automod to automatically remove many of the posts and comments that violate the sub's rules. But the general intent is to keep the discussions civil.

A reminder: Posting rules include — No insults, profanity, incivility, trolling, or bigotry. Nothing that is rude, vulgar or offensive. Nothing gross or disgusting.(https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/6v6fl9/a_reminder_posting_rules_include_no_insults/)

Plus: Don't modify article titles except to add a location in brackets unless the title is excessively misleading, vague, or clickbait-ish. Don't rely upon reddit's ""use suggested title"" feature.

There has been an increase in altered and editorialized titles the last few months.

wojok0,fastfood,I tried the Panda Express chicken strips,"You may have seen [the post the other day](https://www.chewboom.com/2022/08/11/panda-express-tests-new-hand-breaded-chicken-strips/) about them, they're testing it at Innovation Kitchen in Pasadena CA, which is where I happen to live, so I went in today to give it a try.

They're cooked to order so you get it fresh, alongside fresh fries. They were regular straight-cut fries like you'd get at a burger spot, not crinkle fries as in the photo. They were kinda like the fries at The Habit if you've ever had those.

They are definitely hand-breaded, as advertised. The breading is a bit coarser than your typical chicken strip. The breading itself has very little flavor, the chicken inside has a very mild flavor like it was marinated in saltwater maybe with a very few spices. 

They're a bit crispier than your average chicken strips and I'm afraid mine were ever so slightly overcooked. From a texture perspective, they do have a very satisfying crunch when you bite into them. There was no gristle or bad meat in any of my strips, it was all high quality chicken breast.

They have very little overall flavor, which doesn't make them bad, it just makes them kinda bland. I think they're relying on you getting the flavor from the sauces: A creamy sweet chili sauce and a hot habanero honey. And that leads to the flaw in my reporting:

I'm an absolute pepper baby. I can't handle even regular ol black pepper. On occasion, Panda's orange chicken can be too spicy for me to eat depending on how the batch is prepared. And I couldn't handle either of these sauces. I'm sure to an average palate they're delicious and flavorful, but I'm the wrong guy to be testing them. For that I apologize. I'll leave the sauces to someone else to review.

I ended up pairing the chicken strips with much milder sauces: a packet of McDonald's sweet & sour (which did NOT pair well, just was the wrong flavor to combine with this particular chicken strip) and a packet of Chick Fil A BBQ sauce (which was AMAZING with the Panda strips). 

It was 3 strips with fries for $7, or 4 strips with fries for $8. Might as well spend the extra dollar and get the 4th IMHO. These prices are fairly reasonable and approximately in line with the competition in this space. Although the serving of fries was smaller than most competitors. I was able to finish the whole plate and felt full by the end.


Overall, while they certainly weren't *bad,* they weren't extraordinary enough to make me go to Panda and order them over some of the other exceptional things on the menu. Panda's food is really good and I get cravings for their various specialties often. It's hard to recommend the chicken strips over anything else that Panda does SO WELL when Raising Cane's exists. 

I commend Panda for trying new things though. I just don't know if these would be a big enough seller to justify the extra labor cost in deploying them nationally.

The sub is now at 30,125 subscribers, so it passed 30,000 users yesterday (Tuesday Dec 12) when there were 95 new members in one day.

The last three months has seen a moderate increase in pageviews, but an even bigger jump in unique pageviews (plus a jump in subscriptions). I think some of that has been that there has been an increase in different users posting to the sub, plus postings from more different news sources. I want to thank all the users who have been posting links to the sub.

But I'm not sure what happened this last week where the subscribers/day almost doubled during the week. Lots of students visiting /r/FastFood instead of studying for finals?

Whatever the reasons, welcome to /r/FastFood.

To both the old and new members of the sub, I suggest that you review the sub's rules in the sidebar. This sub is a little more actively moderated than some subs on reddit, plus it uses automod to automatically remove many of the posts and comments that violate the sub's rules. But the general intent is to keep the discussions civil.

 [A reminder: Posting rules include — No insults, profanity, incivility, trolling, or bigotry. Nothing that is rude, vulgar or offensive. Nothing gross or disgusting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/6v6fl9/a_reminder_posting_rules_include_no_insults/)

l78teo,fastfood,Tried the New Detroit-Style Pizza at Pizza Hut,"The new Detroit-Style Pizza is not good.

The new sauce they are using IS NOT good. It has an unpleasant flavor that I’m not able to describe, but it made the pizza very difficult to eat because of how much I did not like it. It was very bright and acidic, but there was a taste to it that was not enjoyable.

I got the double pepperoni and the small pepperoni cups were excellent. I have always been a supporter of the small pepperoni cups over normal pepperoni found at other pizza chains. They crisped up nicely in the oven and added great texture as well as flavor.

The crust, however, was disappointing. I am an avid lover of crispy cheese and I was excited for this pizza because of it, but unfortunately, there was a noticeable lack of crispy cheese around the crust of the pizza. The corner pieces were especially lacking. Of course, this could be because of the person who made my pizza, but it was disappointing nonetheless. The dough is just start Pizza Hut dough.

The rest of the pizza was what you expect from Pizza Hut. Same cheese, same quality of toppings, same dough. Would I get this pizza again? No, I would not. The sauce completely ruins the pizza in my opinion, and despite having said it took them 8 tries to perfect it on the blog, I think they need to do a better job",2021-01-28 21:05:26,2024-04-08 22:47:52.302000,1166 days 01:42:26.302000,85,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/l78teo/tried_the_new_detroitstyle_pizza_at_pizza_hut/

8scks4,fastfood,"Do you get double cheeseburgers, McDoubles, or double hamburgers at McDonald's? Is there a taste difference to you?","Hearing people talk about differences between double cheeseburgers and the McDouble got me thinking of why I order the way I do. Often, I buy doubles from McDonald's because they're tasty and economical. What I order depends on where I am that day. A McDonald's near me sells double hamburgers for $1.29, while another sells them for $1.59. The latter restaurant sells McDoubles for $1.29, so I'll buy those instead. Price differences sometimes matters, big or small. That lets me explore the different flavors of these sandwiches.

I know some people prefer one, and I respect that, but I'm a fan of all three. It just depends on either price (""Am I broke?"") or if I'm going to splurge on the extra cheese.

Taste can be a major factor. Noticeable taste differences between the double hamburger, double cheeseburger, and McDouble stem from how ingredients mingle with each other. Double hamburgers have a nice beefiness, where the seasonings and condiments compliment the meat well. In my opinion, the same is true with freshly-made Quarter Pound Hamburgers: the meat's juiciness is enhanced by the seasoning and mustard. 

McDoubles are a happy medium, because that piece of cheese melts nicely between patties. In addition, it doesn't overtake the beefiness or seasonings unless there's too much ketchup. Double cheeseburgers rely on cheese enhancing the sandwich. On double cheeseburgers, ketchup is noticeably messier because the top cheese blocks the meat from absorbing some of the condiments. Double cheeseburgers can be slightly greasier than either double hamburger or McDoubles.

These sandwiches are really simple--just a bun, some meat, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and seasoning--but it's really neat how 1, 2, or no cheese slices really impacts their flavor.

What do you think? Do you just order the same thing, or do you mix it up a little depending on price, allergies, whether you're in a cheesy mood, etc?",2018-06-19 21:17:33,2024-04-08 22:47:52.302025,2120 days 01:30:19.302025,66,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/8scks4/do_you_get_double_cheeseburgers_mcdoubles_or/

bsnsty,fastfood,Some reminders about reddit rules and redditquette about voting (and other stuff),"/r/FastFood is still a relative small sub, so the impact of a few negative votes are far greater than a much larger sub like say /r/pics.

Since today seems to have more [Negative Nancies](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/negative_Nancy#Noun) than usual:

https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette 

* consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, and do so carefully and tactfully.
* Actually read an article before you vote on it (as opposed to just basing your vote on the title).
 * [and the same for commenting - mods] 

### Please don't: 

#### In regard to voting

* Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. 
* Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it.

#### In regard to comments

* Announce your vote (with rare exceptions). ""Upvote"" and ""Downvote"" aren't terribly interesting comments and only increase the noise to signal ratio.
* Complain about the votes you do or do not receive, especially by making a submission voicing your complaint. 

### Plus: 

* Look for the original source of content, and submit that. Often, a blog will reference another blog, which references another, and so on with everyone displaying ads along the way. Dig through those references and submit a link to the creator, who actually deserves the traffic.

Today there was a post that was two links removed from the source article and basically was turned into a very misleading article. 

Always try to find the source. Avoid posting websites that rarely do original reporting such as MSN, AOL, Yahoo, etc.

As an experiment, downvotes are now disabled if you are using the sub's stylesheet.

bsnsty,fastfood,Some reminders about reddit rules and redditquette about voting (and other stuff),"/r/FastFood is still a relative small sub, so the impact of a few negative votes are far greater than a much larger sub like say /r/pics.

Since today seems to have more [Negative Nancies](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/negative_Nancy#Noun) than usual:

https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette 

* consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, and do so carefully and tactfully.
* Actually read an article before you vote on it (as opposed to just basing your vote on the title).
 * [and the same for commenting - mods] 

### Please don't: 

#### In regard to voting

* Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. 
* Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it.

#### In regard to comments

* Announce your vote (with rare exceptions). ""Upvote"" and ""Downvote"" aren't terribly interesting comments and only increase the noise to signal ratio.
* Complain about the votes you do or do not receive, especially by making a submission voicing your complaint. 

### Plus: 

* Look for the original source of content, and submit that. Often, a blog will reference another blog, which references another, and so on with everyone displaying ads along the way. Dig through those references and submit a link to the creator, who actually deserves the traffic.

Today there was a post that was two links removed from the source article and basically was turned into a very misleading article. 

Always try to find the source. Avoid posting websites that rarely do original reporting such as MSN, AOL, Yahoo, etc.

----

As an experiment, downvotes are now disabled if you are using the sub's stylesheet.

vecnwn,HealthyFood,Managed to kick all processed sugar out of my diet…the result,"Drinking my coffee black, no more cereal, now it’s steel cut oatmeal with just a small bit of raw, pure honey. No more desserts, milk, etc.

I cut back drastically on sugar a few months ago now have completely cut it out. I’m sort of amazed at the results on my taste buds.

Without all that sugar constantly bombarding my pallet I feel like my taste receptors have sort of reset themselves. All fruit is tasting absolutely amazing now. Strawberries are no longer too tart. Heck, I’ve even started eating grapefruit and now really like the flavor. Right now an orange is my dessert and I absolutely look forward to it. It’s like eating candy. It tastes delicious.

I’ve also sort of started to embrace the more natural flavors of bitter and tart. I now like the taste of black coffee. It has a nice nutty, acidic, sweet yet bitter taste. 

I feel like I’m finally able to sense how food is suppose to taste. My food is requiring less salt too to taste good. I’m enjoying the raw, more natural flavors of things way more.

Like last night’s dinner: red, yellow, orange pepper slices and pork cubes sautéed with garlic, onion, ginger, turmeric, cayenne pepper, paprika over brown rice. Used much less salt than I normally did and absolutely loved the flavors.

EDIT: I’ve always loved to cook and absolutely love grocery shopping. I guess that helps.

I also stopped drinking 6 months ago and have put myself on a steady exercise routine of cardio, strength training and stretching/yoga. Before this as a middle age male I was way over my ideal weight, my joints/knees hurt constantly, bad sleep, etc. 

I’ve lost 30lbs so far, my joints/knees have stopped hurting, I have way more energy for my children, my memory has improved, I’m more alert. I just feel so much better.

EDIT 2: This was a long, slow process. I didn't go cold turkey. It took 6 months, carefully eliminating 1 thing at a time, adding in healthy options.

102eex2,HealthyFood,"Eating healthy food is easy, giving up unhealthy food is hard","I (M26) have been blessed with a metabolism and GI track that can handle pretty much anything I throw at it (except lettuce ironically). I’ve never struggled with adverse effects of eating what I want, when I want it. For the past year though, I’ve been working hard to eat healthy alternatives. Choosing minimally processed foods, dodging PUFAs like Mike Tyson, and eating more fruits and veggies. 

My hope was that as I did this, it would become easy to just give up fast food all together. Turns out, that’s not what happened. I still get hammered with cravings for a Wendy’s burger, or Bojangles fries, or a Popeyes crispy spicy sandwich. It’s pretty much a daily thing and while I have learned not to pull into that drive through, I still feel such a powerful craving for it. 

You may think this has to do with dietary issues, maybe something I’m leaving out of my nutrient profile. I really don’t think this is the case though, because I feel full. I’m not low carb or low fat, certainly not low sodium. Just eating normal non-fast food. Yet the desire for objectively nasty food persists.

12b9b7w,HealthyFood,My wife and I have been eating healthy food for the past month and it's really depressing me.,"We're trying to reduce caloric intake and lower our sodium consumption.  My wife is doing OK snacking on yogurt and granola, baked salt-free vegetable chips and rice cakes etc. but I cannot *stand* any of that stuff and would rather do without than eat it.  

About the only healthy food I enjoy is fresh fruit, but I still crave salty, savory snack foods very much.  Every now and then I will roast some salt-free spicy sunflower seeds for myself,  but that's kind of a big chore.  

Maybe I will live longer from this diet, or maybe it will just feel that way, because I really, really miss tasty, substantial snacks like salted nuts, potato chips, salami sandwiches, etc.

There is no singular magic diet for everyone on the planet. People have varying dietary needs / goals depending on physical condition, health issues, age, goals, and dietary and activity history. A 325 lb college freshman linebacker, an 85 lb underweight adult or pre-teen, and a diabetic have differing needs. 

Avoid *always* scenarios, assumptions, and generalizations. Bashing on others demanding some macro / micro is all bad or all great for every person on the planet is unrealistic and not the way to discuss food nutritive content here.

Lastly and most important, for those seeking advice here about personal diet (and those trying to sneak in health concerns), proper and accurate advice involves;

* testing to establish current values, tracking over time, and impacts from changes
* examination of medical and family history
* examination of dietary history and activity

This will always be many times over more accurate and safe than resorting to 1) anonymous strangers who most often are not specialists or educated on the topic 2) people who do not have the proper info to advise you for your specific circumstance and 3) the horrid but realistic possibility that anonymous uninformed sources may either unintentionally or, sadly worse, intentionally give harmful advice

16eexad,HealthyFood,r/HealthyFood subreddit update - Post changes,"Hi,

## The problem

Posts are getting a bit outside the scope of the sub more frequently. These kinds of posts consistently involve critical information gaps by posters and responders. There is also a problem of not having enough moderators for a sub of this size (we'll cover that concern at the end). Therefore, some key changes will be made to this subreddit in order to get things back to center for its topic, focus, and purpose.

The misunderstanding some are having about this sub is like confusing a cat subreddit for a pet subreddit. A cat is a pet but the cat sub is not the right sub for dog questions. We're getting the equivalent of a LOT of dog questions, lizard questions, snake questions, rabbit cage design questions, etc. 

Some people, most often site and sub newcomers, are getting confused and even angry that this sub isn't an anything-ever-possibly-related-to-food sub. 

**What the sub is:** It's for focus on the food itself, specific food, a meal the poster wants to share and get info and opinions on. This sub was founded as a sibling to the food subreddit where posters share food they've had, but here it also focuses on the meal's content and composition, including any ingredient changes made to improve nutritional value, increased or reduced macro / micro values (note the use of *improve*, not *achieved perfection*).

**What the sub is not:** a general nutrition, diet, and health concern consultation forum. The focus needs to get back to being food / specific meal centric, not overarching personal diet, broad food categories, or general nutrition centric.

**You can consult more than one friend / source:** For some questions, another sub may be the better option and that's a good thing. There are several great subreddits which specifically focus on the topic of diet, budget, fitness, general nutrition, and combinations thereof. For example, /r/eatcheapandhealthy and /r/nutrition are great subs related to food and nutrition, each with their own focus, Please add the power of other subs to your info arsenal and enjoy conversing there too with the people who are dedicated to discussing those topics.

*EDIT - Another reason why this sub needs to focus solely on the food and not the person is there is an inherent problem with diet, health concern, and personal context related posts on reddit which is far more concerning than being outside the intent of the sub: The reality is that without these things, which are never provided and would be too personal to do so here, responses are blind guesses that have more than a small possibility of being wrong and can even be dangerous: proper testing, medical history, activity patterns, family history, and an evaluation from an accredited professional who is fully and properly educated in their specialization staying up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. Whereas what happens here is 1) an anonymous person with no accountability will be making wild guesses 2) based on extremely limited and incomplete information provided about the personal scenario and 3) the advice provided tends to be an assessment based on a couple of skimming glances of semi related social media posts sometimes rising to paraphrasing of studies except often done poorly. Responders are very rarely offering links to studies or proper sources of information. This is even before we get to the problem of trolls pretending to be professionals and worse, scumbags who intentionally and maliciously give dangerous advice. No offense folks since we all know the person asking and the vast majority of people answering mean well but this information shortfall from all angles resulting in blind guesswork with more than a small potential for being off the mark is the reality behind the advice going on for these kinds of posts on reddit.*

Now for a short non-commercial break from the heaviness of this topic, ala derp cats https://redd.it/16e9cb1  
...and back to the program...

## Changes to this sub

**Front page posts** - Going forward, this subreddit will be returning to its founding purpose. Front page posts will be limited to ""here's the healthful food I ate"" type image posts. The current added info comment requirement for food image posts will remain in place so participants get ingredient / recipe info as well as macro / micro notes for the food shown. **Text posts will be off the board until enough volunteers have joined the mod team to keep up with them**. 

**The promotion post** - this is going away. The sub will simply no longer allow spam / promotion anywhere in the forum.

**A new weekly pinned info / help request post (starting Monday)** - We don't like people getting confused or angry for wanting help while misunderstanding and being road blocked for it. Therefore, this pinned post will be provided for those who want to ask things here which are food related but are tangential to the sub purpose. These kinds of queries include;

* anything diet oriented - requests for diet analysis, food / drink suggestions, evaluations, ""how much"", ""too much"", ""is this bad for me?"" etc. 
* general nutrition and food category queries - broad food groups like ""dairy"", ""meat"", ""vegetables"", ""melons"", etc. rather than single meal specific
* and for now, anything else that would've been a text post, anything which isn't about a single specific meal with an image of the food shared for discussion
* Note: queries with any context involving a health issue, concern, diagnosis, treatment, etc. will continue to be out of bounds for this sub and will be auto removed (refer to a professional)


We want folks to get their desired info / discussion pertaining to food but we need the sub front page to be clear at a glance what its purpose / topic is so newcomer confusion is kept to a minimum. 

We should have made adjustments when the sub hit major growth, putting topical guardrails in place to prevent the deviation from getting to the level it has. Apologies for that, we've been busy with other mod needs (see below). Taking the steps now to restrict the front page to the sub purpose and adding a weekly (or more frequent) info / help discussion post for food related queries seems to be the best way to get things back on track.

---

## Moderator help is urgently needed

We have only three active human moderators for a sub of over 3 million subscribers. Because of poorly thought out changes by the site regarding third party apps, our bot help has recently been crippled. For years, we've been way beyond the point of needing more volunteers for the mod team and we're at a breaking point.

Pretty much all our volunteer time is taken up dealing with spammers / scammers. The ratio of spam to legit content here is unusually high compared to other subs. As for the non-spam posts, we simply don't have the eyeball resources to analyze every text post for topical relevance or time to debate it. To open the sub up to other kinds of posts again isn't going to be realistic without bringing additional mod volunteers on board.

Volunteers with moderating experience would be great but we're happy to give pointers to those who are new to it.

Things you need to know if you want to mod: Scammers go to amazing lengths. Bot / AI engagement here is going on much more than you think. People can get to ugly mode fast and some are dangerous. The issues which have to be addressed rarely are just what they seem on the surface so you'll have to enjoy detective work. Site admin support is really bad and claims regarding their efforts tend to prove hollow. Yes, it can get bad like kids pretending to be doctors while intentionally giving malicious advice for funsies or a pervert posting to the person they're stalking their desire to violently hurt the child target (yep, it happened here and site admin refused to help or even talk to us about it). Moderating is not glorious. Shit gets (un)real

16cxhg8,HealthyFood,"Butter, Margarine vs Table spread","Hi all! Really appreciate your professional feedback on this matter.

Throughout my entire life, I’ve been told that butter is healthier compared to Margarine but recently I’ve found out that Butter actually contains higher fat (HDL/LDL) compared to Margarine (80%). 

Now the question is, is this really true? 

Also, looking back at the matter, I discovered the table spreads (not in my home country), which is advertised lower in fat compared to Margarine. 

Again, is this true?

Looking at the ingredients, 99% they say vegetable oil include yet the evidence suggests the so called vegetable oil is the palm oil (which most are saying bad for health). 

Appreciate your support.

Ps. Which one is the healthiest?

Many thanks!",2023-09-08 01:55:05,2024-04-08 22:51:32.373038,213 days 20:56:27.373038,36,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/16cxhg8/butter_margarine_vs_table_spread/

I consume a fair bit of milk directly and by making yogurt. I also enjoy using cream and butter in cooking and eating.

162s54j,HealthyFood,Beet Jerky: any brands or flavors that don’t taste like mulch?,"I’ve been hearing a lot about how nutritious beets are, and that there’s this product called “beet jerky”. Now I love a good food pun (chick’n nuggets anyone?), I love jerky, but I’m not really a beet fan. But if you can turn it into a jerky-like product and flavor it up with pepper or garlic how bad it could be?

So I tried sesame-ginger teriyaki beet jerky. I broke off a small piece, reminded myself it’s not really beef jerky, and ate it. 

I can only describe the flavor and mouthfeel as raked up wet leaves. It was awful. I couldn’t taste sesame, ginger, or teriyaki, just this earthy flavor with beet undertones that required quite a bit of chewing before I could force it down. I couldn’t bring myself to try another bite. 

I wasn’t expecting it to taste like beef jerky but I was hoping it would at least be palatable. 

Again, I’m not really a beet fan so maybe this is impossible, it’s just not for me. But I’m hoping there’s a product out there that isn’t this bad. 

Has anyone found a brand or flavor that you actually enjoy?",2023-08-27 14:40:04,2024-04-08 22:51:32.373096,225 days 08:11:28.373096,20,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/162s54j/beet_jerky_any_brands_or_flavors_that_dont_taste/

1. If I wash them and put them in a glass container, they get really stick/icky and watery. So now I don't wash them.
2. They tend to get pretty moldy if I leave them in their original container in about 5-7 days.

15th4pb,HealthyFood,Fruits and veggies Shake,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I’ve recently made a change in my diet where I’ve started drinking my daily intake of fruits and vegetables instead of consuming them in their whole form. This decision was partly due to time constraints and the fact that I didn’t really enjoy eating them in the first place. I’ve been wondering if my body still gets the same nutrients as it would from eating them, logically speaking. What do you think?

Question 1: Do you believe that my body receives the same nutrients when I drink my daily fruits and veggies as it would if I were to eat them?

On a related note, I’ve noticed that my bowel movements have become quite “fluid,” occurring around 2 to 3 times a day and with a very liquid consistency. I attribute this change to the reduced intake of solid foods. However, I’m concerned that this might suggest my body isn’t fully absorbing all the necessary nutrients from the fruits and vegetables, given that they might be passing through my system too quickly.

Question 2: Could the frequent and liquid bowel movements be an indicator that my body isn’t efficiently absorbing the nutrients from the fruits and vegetables due to their speedy passage?

I’m open to any advice or insights you might have regarding this situation. Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and experiences!",2023-08-17 08:20:22,2024-04-08 22:51:32.373230,235 days 14:31:10.373230,19,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/15th4pb/fruits_and_veggies_shake/

157kf7y,HealthyFood,A question about the red meat carcinogen study,"Good evening! I was reading about the health of certain foods to educate myself and came across the “red meat is a carcinogen” theory. I feel like it’s often described as a fact but if I read it correctly, it says that “processed meats are a level 1 carcinogen, same as cigarettes” (i find that shocking and hard to believe because either it’s much worse than most people think, or cigarettes are not as bad, or that “level 1” is a bit broad) and that red meat is a “level 2a carcinogen”, and they said that eating an equivalent of 2 slices of bacon per day increases risks by 1%.

Now wait a minute bacon is processed food, and 2a means it’s “probably” a carcinogen and why has over the last years red meat been so bashed if there is “only” one study suggesting that there may be a link? Why aren’t there more studies? I’m not saying that this study is bad but i’m definitely not saying that every study is good, so why isn’t there more evidence on something we’ve been eating since the dawn of time?

14megk1,HealthyFood,Is drinking 2 cups of milk sugar coffee everyday alright?,"I have medium cups of milk coffee (no creamer, 1.5 teaspoons of sugar) twice a day. I want to lose weight, be more active and feel better but coffee keeps me going in life so I don't want to quit it entirely. What are some suggestions to sustain weight loss while also not having to quit coffee?

Edit: 1. I am a vegetarian (if that's relevant)
2. I am not from North America so the region specific suggestions might not apply (thanks anyways though :))
3. I cannot afford high quality roasted coffee and instant coffee tastes shit when made black
4. I use about 175 ml of skimmed milk per cup of coffee
5. I also do not have access to plant based milk and artificial sweeteners

I know these edits make my situation seem impossible but it is what it is I guess. Also, I wasn't expecting to be judged for my dietary choices. My culture, region, spending ability also weigh into my dietary choices so yeah :) 

One suggestion that seems to be workable is reducing the quanity of milk and/or substituting the reduced quantity with water.

Fruit I will eat:

* Apples

Vegetables:

* Bell peppers
* Onions
* Broccoli
* Cauliflower
* Peas
* Corn
* Potatoes
* Cucumbers
* Tomatos (i like them well enough for salad/pizza but ive never been a fan of V8 etc)

When it comes to artificial flavors I like fake cherry as jolly rancher/starburst, same for orange and lemon. I like strawberry poptarts but i know that is a super fake flavor as I hate strawberry flavors in many other things.

I know what I'm asking is a tall order but if someone knows any solid recipes I can use to make basically a meal replacement with some chocolate/peanut butter (protein) powder that would be healthier i would greatly appreciate it.

14k35s0,HealthyFood,"I'm bored of just drinking water, so what else do you drink?","A little bit of context: I'm honestly not a very healthy person and I live a pretty sedentary life, but about a year ago I started trying to at least watch my intake of things like sugar/sodium/etc. I ended up cutting out sodas and really most other drinks entirely, having only bottled or tap water. Now, about a year later, I've tried to branch out and find other drinks that aren't just plain ol' water yet aren't chock full of sugar or some problematic sweetener. I'm back to having a specialty soda or a ginger ale very occasionally; not even because I miss soda, but because I just want something different.

Looking into this kind question already, tons of answers end up suggesting sparkling waters, seltzers, and infused waters. Now normally I'm not a picky eater, but having tried all of these on several occasions, I just don't like them for different reasons. I've also tried kombucha but it sorta turned my stomach, which was a bummer, and I don't know whether or not one should be drinking that constantly due to the bacteria anyway (correct me if I'm wrong, I just don't know). I also tried coconut water a long time ago, and while I didn't like it at the time, I think I'll give it another shot now that I think about it. I've always enjoyed some cold teas or juices, but finding things that I can drink frequently throughout the day without overloading on sugar has been the main challenge.

TL;DR - Aside from water and its spinoffs, what things do you guys like to drink on the regular? Is anyone else picky with sparking/seltz/infused waters but found a kind that you like? Are there any teas or juices you might recommend that don't have a lot of added sugar and such?

Bonus question: Are there any sweeteners you're okay with, or any you'd recommend against having?

13xj8oq,HealthyFood,Why does eating steak make me feel great? Is there a scientific basis behind it?,"I recently noticed that consuming steak leaves me feeling fantastic, and I'm curious to understand the reasons behind it. Despite reducing my meat consumption over the past few months, I decided to indulge in a BBQ and thoroughly enjoyed some steaks. Surprisingly, I felt amazing afterward.

Is this feeling merely psychological or is there a scientific explanation for it? Steak is known to be a rich source of protein, iron, zinc, and various B-vitamins, which are essential for overall health. However, I have been obtaining these nutrients through other sources during my reduced-meat phase. Is there something unique about steak that contributes to this experience?

I would appreciate hearing from those who have experienced similar post-meal sensations after consuming steak. Have you noticed any changes in well-being or energy levels? Is there scientific evidence supporting these effects?

While maintaining a balanced diet and aligning choices with personal health goals is important, exploring the potential health benefits of moderate steak consumption could be worthwhile. Is having a well-prepared steak once a week beneficial in terms of energy, nutrient absorption, or muscle function?

Please share your thoughts, experiences, and any scientific insights you may have on this topic. I'm interested in understanding the potential connection between eating steak and the positive effects it may have on our well-being.",2023-06-01 14:37:04,2024-04-08 22:51:34.972734,312 days 08:14:30.972735,166,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/13xj8oq/why_does_eating_steak_make_me_feel_great_is_there/

13pbpum,HealthyFood,Greek Yogurt in Cookies?? Lengthy Post Ahead,"Yes.. exactly 
I love baking, and typically make my own cookies and brownies so I can bring them to work to eat as a snack. However due my dramatic work schedule change to overnight, I’ve been trying to adjust and baking wasn’t at my interest. 

Now that I’m back into, I was wondering what I can do to change up the recipe to increase the protein and fiber content. 

I’ve made the switch of using regular white flour to Kodiak pancake mix already. But I wanted to change the butter to something else. Don’t tell me about coconut oil. I hate how it completely changes the texture of the cookie. I prefer semi dense and CHEWY cookies 🤤 

So I saw you can substitute butter for Greek yogurt. If using by itself you could do a 1:1 ratio or less. In this instance I used 3/4 cups because greek yogurt is said to add more moisture to the cookies than butter. Additionally I added a cup of blended oats with 2 cups of the pancake mix

At first, when I completely the batter I was concerned because it was liquidity than normal. But the taste was alright, the oat flour threw me off. Right the batter is in the fridge so we’ll see if anything is different

13odhcw,HealthyFood,"Vegan ""Fish"" Tofu (Starring Fish Mint leaves, Nori Seaweed and Black Salt)","Ingredients:

\- 1 cup of Water

\- 1 block of Firm Tofu

\- 1/2 teaspoon Black Salt

\- 2 tablespoons Fish Mint leaves (Houttuynia Cordata)

\- 2 tablespoon Nori powder (or finely crushed nori sheets)

\- 1 tablespoon Tamari (lower sodium brand if possible)

\- 1 teaspoon Garlic powder

\- 1 teaspoon Onion Powder

\- 1/2 teaspoon White Pepper

\- 2 tablespoons Corn Starch (enough to coat)

\- 2 tablespoons Sesame Oil (for Pan-frying)

Instructions:

1.) Press the Tofu to remove excess moisture: Wrap the Tofu block in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, place it in a large plate, and put a heavy object on top (such as a book or a plate with cans). Let it sit for about 15-20 minutes to press out the liquid. Drain and repeat in 5 minute intervals until you think the liquid is mostly removed.

2.) Slice the pressed tofu into thin cubed strips.

\*For more spongey texture, and maximum absorbency while marinating, freeze overnight after slicing and thaw out in the fridge the next day.

3.) When you're ready to move on, use a Mortar and Pestle to finely crush the Fish Mint leaves. Do not attempt to dry cook or dehydrate the leaves for any reason, as Fish Mint loses potency if the oils in the leaf dry out.

4.) In a bowl filled with 1 cup of water, combine the finely crushed Fish Mint leaves, Nori Powder, Black Salt, Tamari, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, and White Pepper. Mix well to create a marinade.

5.) Place the tofu slices in a shallow dish or container and pour the marinade over them. Make sure all sides are coated evenly. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or longer for a stronger fish-like flavor. \*For the strongest flavor, refrigerate the tofu and let it marinate overnight for better results!

6.) After marinating, remove the tofu and transfer it to a plate. Sprinkle Corn starch over the tofu, coating each piece evenly.

\*Before you start cooking, you should consider using the marinade to make a liquid to baste the Tofu as you cook it. You can either strain the marinade as is, or for stronger flavor, just use a Food Processor on high power, then strain it. Boil the marinade medium heat and reduce the marinade to a watery gravy consistency.

7.) Heat Sesame oil in a skillet or frying pan over medium heat.

8.) Carefully place the tofu slices in the pan, making sure not to overcrowd. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden and crispy. While cooking, spoon small amounts of the leftover marinade onto the tofu for added flavor.

9.) Once cooked, remove the tofu from the pan and let it cool on a plate.",2023-05-22 02:13:11,2024-04-08 22:51:34.972827,322 days 20:38:23.972827,3,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/13odhcw/vegan_fish_tofu_starring_fish_mint_leaves_nori/

13ndwi7,HealthyFood,Just wanted to share a few prepped salad tips that have worked for me lately.,"I posted a while ago asking for healthy snack tips, and how to eat more salads without hating my life.. so I want to share the results with you in case you have similar goals.

To eat more salads I bought the large container of pre washed mixed greens. I used to wash them too but I'm trying to be less anal about it and I haven't been washing them if it says pre washed. I've been buying different trail mix bags and leaving them on the counter (even though I hate clutter, but if I have the trail mix on the counter it will remind me to eat that instead of something else, or remind me to make the salad). My favorite hack lately has been pre making the dressing with one of those teeny Tupperwares. I mixed olive oil, balsamic, fresh lemon juice, a little bit of honey, salt, and pepper in a Tupperware. I used it for almost a week and it honestly tasted fine all week after a quick stir.

I prepped a can of chick peas by draining them and rinsing them and storing them in a Tupperware in the fridge. My cheat portion in the salad is the croutons, if you love croutons just sneak a few in or if you have the discipline to refrain from using croutons then your salad would be even healthier ! To prep the chicken I made a week's worth of instant pot chicken breast. I froze one or two and defrosted them as the days went on. I had almost a week's worth of salads with mixed greens, trail mix (cranberries, almonds, seeds, pistachios, etc), chicken, croutons, chick peas, and homemade dressing. I did not take the extra effort to chop additional vegetables for the salad, but maybe some days I will. I have a very large Tupperware that I throw most of the dry ingredients in and then I just stuff the Tupperware of dressing in that same Tupperware and I don't mix the dressing in until I am about to eat the salad.

If you really hate prepping chicken, one day I purchased frozen grilled chicken out of desperation for time that week and to be honest it tasted fine on a salad. Just went in the microwave for a couple of minutes to defrost. If you're vegetarian just substitute chicken with hard boiled eggs. If you're vegan, just skip both and it is still pretty filling.",2023-05-21 00:33:03,2024-04-08 22:51:34.972830,323 days 22:18:31.972831,24,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/13ndwi7/just_wanted_to_share_a_few_prepped_salad_tips/

Could it be a placebo effect or has anyone noticed similar results when switching to higher quality water?

134fh1o,HealthyFood,Powdered Peanut Butter Preferences,"Powdered Peanut Butter Preferences

Ok so I had been using Crazy Richards PB but because I freaking love PB&J I decided to try out powdered Peanut Butter and Almond Butter. I actually ended up really liking SugarFree PBFit on a PBJ, and prefer it actually because I can make my peanut butter thicker and the sandwich less messy overall. Plus, I find that while the sandwich is still filling, it doesn’t make me feel as heavy afterwards as regular peanut butter. That being said, it’s about time I bought a new container (I’ve just gotten through the first) and I was wondering *for anyone who likes powdered PB* what are your preferences? I’m currently debating between SugarFree PBFit; Original PBFit, PB2 Pure, PB2 Original, and Crazy Richards powered PB - all of which are 60 cals per 2 tbsp, except for the crazy Richards brand which is 50. 

The only reason I don’t want to immediately just go for the crazy Richards brand even though it was the original peanut butter brand I stemmed from and has lower cals is because I can’t buy it in stores around me, so I’d have to buy it online 

Wasn’t sure if there was much of a taste difference between the PBFit SF and original (I think the sugar free is sweet which I know is due to the erythritol) or between PBFit and PB2 (I think I’ve heard most prefer PBFit) and if anyone has had the powdered crazy Richards if it tastes like their regular spread (assuming you’ve had that as well)

133k9o9,HealthyFood,Cook or Toss? Extra processed Tzatziki sauce.,"I was gifted some Tzatziki sauce. I'm trying to lose weight and my first instinct is just to toss it bcz of the extra calories and fat. But I hate wasting food and maybe there's some hidden nutritional benefits I'm not hip to?

If I did keep it, I'd try mixing it with either canned salmon, or my last can of chicken / canned chickpeas, then eat it with white rice. I only have frozen vegetables, and I don't know if they would go well here. Does this sound bad / gross? Those are my only protein options, and my only carb is white rice rn. I do have some dried herbs.

The alternative would be eating those same proteins in a broth soup with frozen veggies and rice. Or eating the salmon with some soy sauce, veggies and rice. If either of these options are markedly healthier than the Tzatziki one, I'll probably just toss unless someone can recommend me a better meal combo. Given how fast it spoils, I'd probably want to use it all up right away.

&#x200B;

Some constraints I'm working with that cannot change:

* I've already tried donating it and no dice
* Cooking for one & I only eat one meal a day & assume my lifestyle is completely sedentary
* Only have access to a microwave and no food processors
* Stuck all my ingredients into the SuperCook website and cannot make any recipes
* Right now I can only purchase the types of canned / dried ingredients you can find in a small dollar store
* I have no fresh meat, produce (besides apples), or most pantry staples. I do not use oil.

132fmuf,HealthyFood,Question on California P65 warning labels on food,"I live in the Midwest (US) and when I cannot recall the last time I saw a California P65  warning on any food in mainstream, US grocery stores like Walmart or Krogers.  

Yet I often see it on imported foods, especially those from China in Asian supermarket, and occasionally on Japanese packaged food too. Usually it warns you about lead or cadmium but when you read the ingredients it all looks normal, nothing artificial.

I wonder why that is. Is it because imported food are truly less safe than US produced food? Or is it because I'm not in California and US food makers only label their products sold in California, whereas foreign food makers have to label everything as they cannot control which states their food end up at? 

So I wonder, have you seen any such labels on US made food? Are they more frequent in California?

12n6vaa,HealthyFood,Oil substitute for air frying,"Hi all,

I've spent the last few years really focusing on changing my diet. After my first couple years of college I gained like 45lbs and was weighing in at 190lbs and at 5'9"", I was definitely chubby and lacked energy all the time. In highschool I played sports, so I got away with bad eating habits and combined with drinking, it all added up fast. I first began trying to get in shape with the goal of ""having a six pack"" immediately after that, and thought running and lifting would get me there. Took a couple years to realize it all started in the kitchen. Then I spent the majority of a year eating a 1200 calorie a day diet, and I did achieve my goals. I actually weighed 135lbs, and was definitely cut like I wanted to be, but I hadn't hit the gym much and lost a lot of muscle. I also couldn't keep that diet up as it was strict, and not to mention 135lbs didn't really seem ""healthy"" either. Even going to the gym was hard because I didn't have the energy to push myself. 

Now, over the last couple years, I've really been focused on just eating healthier and having some self control. I'm not so much trying to get cut anymore and really just want to maintain a healthy life long diet. I actually really like cooking, and instead of forcing myself on a diet I don't like, my new approach has been to find healthier, lower calorie substitutes for foods I actually like. Turkey tacos and burgers, zucchini pastas, homemade low calorie breads and a light meringue crust pizza. A lot of that's been killer and even my non-calorie conscious friends and family members love most of it. One of my favourite tools has been the air fryer. I've been able to get at least decently crispy foods out of it and it's allowed me to add some nice ""fried"" sides to dishes and feel like I'm eating full meals. But I tend to avoid most oils. Just so many different beliefs on which are good and which are bad, and honestly for the most part, I just haven't needed them. But one day I tried making ""fried"" brussel sprouts. It was one of my favorite foods in my go to the gym and running for a six pack phase. Usually they were deep fried which negated any health benefits from the brussel sprouts lol. Unfortunately, they just didn't taste right with out the crispiness they had with deep frying. Honestly, most air fried things lack that extra crispy taste. So I've finally decided I want to find a oil substitute for frying things. I'm not talking deep fried, but instead I'd still be air frying, I'd just like something that I can coat foods with to get to that extra level of crispy and add some of the taste if possible. Every time I look up oil substitutes on Google I get back the same lists of alternative oils, or oil substitutes for baking. So I figured I'd ask y'all. 

Does anyone know of low calorie frying oil substitutes or methods? Please don't suggest other oils and tell me why they are healthier than _____ oil and how just using a little is fine. I understand and appreciate that, but that's just not my goal. 

Thanks in advance.",2023-04-15 15:14:06,2024-04-08 22:51:35.946649,359 days 07:37:29.946649,29,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/12n6vaa/oil_substitute_for_air_frying/

I am making some simple banana oatmeal cookies for my cookie cravings. With little bit of dark chocolate chips they turn out great taste wise. But I am missing the crispy texture of cookies in general and the cookies I make are soft. I am in a weight loss journey so I can only afford 200 k cal for cookies in a day. So I am looking for a way to make them crispier without adding too much calorie to the recipe. The only thing I tried so far is baking them in lower heat for a longer time. That created a harder layer at the outside but inside was still very soft. So I want to learn what are my options or if it is possible without using granulated sugar as I think that's the ingredient that adds crispiness.

50g Oatmeal Flour

1 small banana

15g erythritol

10g dark chocolate chips

Coconut powder

Cinnamon

Salt

12iulti,HealthyFood,What's the best substitute for olive oil or butter in neutral Pasta?,"My go to pasta is just olive oil or butter plus different  spices. But both olive oil and butter are too high calorie for me when I'm trying to lose weight. What would be a good alternative so I can lube up my pasta lol

&#x200B;

Edit:

Many people are telling me to cut out or drastically reduce the pasta intake. You're right... but I've been successful in losing weight for the past few months eating 500 calorie chicken and protein pasta meals. I'm only a few pounds away from my goal. Additionally, I can't put into words how much I like pasta. Not well enough to properly illustrate it to you. For reference, on my gf's phone, my nickname is Pasta King. 

One more thing:

Recommending me tomato sauce kind of defeats the purpose of maintaining a simple pasta dish. I'm just trying to find a neutral coating so I can put on my usual spices and a little parm. That being said, I still appreciate the responses and you've given me some interesting sauces to try.

And he also said that bottled oils are bad, even olive oil, because they extracted from products, and we don’t have enzymes to process the olive oil, instead we should eat whole olives, because they do have enzymes. 

And he also said that preservatives, enhancers and conditioners are really bad, and people should avoid it. I don’t know what it is exactly, and how these scary words affect our body…

Is that so bad that I eat bread from store bought flour, and salads with olive oil, and I make soups from packaged broth and canned beans and tomatoes? I mean in the long-term for health.

1264684,HealthyFood,Soda vs bad snacks/food - Is soda worse?,"My recent weight gains have given me a serious reality check on eating healthier, so I've started to change this up since a few days and search around the internet. On average, I ate about 700kcal+ a day just on snacks alone with 2 ''no sugar/light/diet'' soda's a day.

I realized these no sugars are just as bad for my health and weight gain as a normal one, and that 1 can a day is even already too much. I cut down my snacks a lot and try to keep it under 200kcal a day now in a slightly more healthy way too.

But after having watched many videos about how bad soda is online, I started to wonder, do all these negative things also apply to the unhealthy snacks? Cookies, chocolate, chips etc. Or is soda actually worse than unhealthy snacks?

Of course, both are bad but, are soda's worse than unhealthy snacks?

12414l8,HealthyFood,Would you rather give up sugar or pasta?,"I had a little debate with my girlfriend about which one would be a tastier ""cheat"" choice because we're both working on cutting the extra kilos, and we can't afford too many cals and carbs. My pick was, of course, pasta because I feel like it's a bit healthier than sugar and it can actually fulfill you instead of giving you a short burst of energy, but she argued that sugar can be of great use when you need some food for the brain and that sugar-rich foods simply taste better than pasta.

I honestly couldn't agree with that because it's unimaginable for me to not have any pasta or dough with my food from time to time, and cutting sugar has better long-term effects for the body and the brain. This doesn't mean we'd cut either one out completely and never eat it again, just that we'd try to restrain from that type of food for as much as we can, and consume it only on special occasions.

I also workout daily, and usually pretty strenuously. Obviously as long as I still work out more than I consume unhealthy foods/drinks, I’ll be okay, but I like knowing to the numbers what I’ve accomplished or screwed up.

Today, on my way to work (HVAC installation), I grabbed what I thought was a zero sugar Monster energy drink (now, I know there’s healthier alternatives, but I overslept, that’s all the store had on this particular day, and you know it goes, etc.), and only until halfway through it did I realize it’s the 41g of sugar can. As someone who’s very serious about their diets, this has really put a sour taste on my day as a whole. Could it have been worse? Yeah, could’ve finished the can first. Hell, could’ve finished the can and not even noticed, then wondered why the weight wasn’t coming off.

So half the can being 20.5g of sugar, and if I train hard for an average of 2 hours a day, I don’t intake over 25g of carbs (typically, obviously I’m fucked thanks to that Monster today), and I drink lots of water. Is anyone able to explain simply to me, how much harder I’m gonna have to go to get that extra sugar off?

I finished the entire little mason jar I had made, but it was definitely a struggle. I have tried some things like adding some extra toppings like fruits, nuts and some mini chocolate chips, and it sort of helped, but it wasn't enough to fully mask the texture issues.

11mll9u,HealthyFood,Is it ok to drink/eat stuff after it has deformed the plastic container it was in?,"Ok so this is a weird question, but I have to ask. My mom sometimes cooks butter, let’s it brown up, and then waits for it to cool down before putting it in a plastic container and using it for all kinds of foods. We are arabs, it’s a food thing we do. 
This time around however I notice the plastic container is severely deformed. I’m not sure if it’s because she accidently poured the melted butter into it or because she left the plastic container next to the stove. It’s a square container and only one side is deformed, so I think she just left it close to the stove. 

Is it still safe to use the butter? I have no idea how long she waited before pouring the butter in, and considering the butter is solid at room temp, it must have still been somewhat warm when she pours it in.

11iuqhq,HealthyFood,Has anyone tried homemade frozen yoghurt?,"From what I've said you essentially freeze yoghurt, wait maybe 30 or so minutes, then whip, then repeat until it's the right consistency, around 2 hours with whipping every 30 minutes. (I don't have an icecream machine)

I had a yoghurt bowl this morning and I found I just didn't like the texture of yoghurt. I shamefully added a handful of sugary cereals along with fruit for the texture. It still wasn't enough.

So by the method mentioned before, if I add stevia (strangely, there's no weird aftertaste with stevia in yog), vanilla extract, cinnamon, etc whatever, to the yoghurt, it'd still have the same nutrients from yoghurt, just a different texture right?

I'm using a full fat greek style natural yoghurt, there's no ingredients on it (?) but looking it up it's just milk so I'm not worried about the sugar from the yoghurt itself (there was like 4.5g/125g i think)

**Mainly I wanted to know if anyone has done this, how it turned out, etc? Or if this is a good idea? Health wise, taste wise, whatever.** It seems genius to me which is why I feel like I'm missing something haha.

Update: I tried it, but I messed up by adding peanut butter and cocoa powder. It was bitter and I did not like it, still gonna have it for breakfast tomorrow. Plain with vanilla n cinnamon was much, muchhh better. Added some chia seeds for a little fiber. Texture wise it was great! Nothing exceptional, but I messed up by not mixing it for an hour after first putting it in the freezer cause I had to do stuff, but after that every 30 mins with a fork and it was fine. Pretty low effort honestly, and it took around 6? or less? idk, 2 minute intervals of stirring. I truly regret the peanut butter and cocoa decision, especially the cocoa. At least peanut butter gives some protein. Definitely going to do this in my hopefully sugar-free Ramadan instead of ice cream haha. It does lose the sweetness the more you freeze so I had to add quite a bit of stevia. I'd recommend!

The egg is crispy and slightly cheesy (I didn't add much) on the bottom and the roasted broccoli was crispy and didn't taste greeny at all with the egg.

I know this isn't some great revelation but as someone trying to incorporate more veggies in my diet I was really pleased. Will hopefully have this again today with more broccoli and eggs, maybe some roasted carrots.

Edit: Forgot to mention no oil used at all for the egg. The crispy cheese made it really easy for the egg to come off and it was easier than when I usually did it with oil since I never used enough. Well, until the yolk broke, but still. I did use a non-stick pan.",2023-03-01 18:58:08,2024-04-08 22:51:38.276922,404 days 03:53:30.276922,4,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/11fcj9c/roasted_broccoli_cheese_crisp_eggs_are_really/

11amt3v,HealthyFood,Reducing daily consumption of dairy,"Hi,
I am currently consuming quite a lot of dairy products everyday because I like it a lot (😍) and also because I need to eat a lot because of work-outs, it's an easy way to do snacks, breakfast and so on. 
However, I was thinking to reduce my daily dairy products  because I don't think it's that great to eat too much dairy.
I was thinking to use a protein powder as a supplement to replace a part of the dairy. 
Despite the fact that the whey, or casein are the most common protein, I was thinking to use a pea protein powder as it is a slow digest one. 

Do you think that the consumption of dairy proteins (whey etc) is considered as a proper dairy product because we can often read that proteins from dairy can be harmful in too large quantitieswbut beneficial in moderate amount. 

Do you have any advices on this subject please?",2023-02-24 08:52:18,2024-04-08 22:51:38.276977,409 days 13:59:20.276977,29,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/11amt3v/reducing_daily_consumption_of_dairy/

115blb6,HealthyFood,"How much electrolytes should I consume if I am sweating in the sauna profusely for 30 minutes, and I desire to drink 1500ml of water?","This is a question of what maximum amount of electrolytes are healthy, and how much should I offset the quantity of water I drink.

On an average day, I work out in the gym for 90 minutes prior to going into the sauna. I drink about 20 oz of water during my workout. Then I will go into the sauna for 30 minutes. Rest. Then go back in for another 15 minutes. I sweat profusely in the sauna.

&#x200B;

Here is the electrolyte powder I use: 

Supplement Facts  
Serving Size 1 scoop (3g)  
Amount Per Serving %DV  
Calcium (as Calcium Lactate) 38mg 3%  
Magnesium (as Magnesium Citrate) 60mg 14%  
Chloride (from Sea Salt) 9mg <1%  
Sodium (from Sea Salt) 5mg <1%  
Potassium (as Potassium Citrate) 500mg 11%  
Conce TraceR AC (Trace Mineral Complex) 50mg  
""Daily Value (DV) not established.  
Other Ingredients: Citric acid anhydrous, natural  
flavors, malic acid, steviol glycosides. 

I take the directions with a grain of salt (pun-intended), but they say to mix one scoop with 240ml of water and follow with ""plenty of fluids."" I tend to have 6 scoops total throughout my sauna sessions. 

&#x200B;

If you can figure it out from there, that's great. But if not, here's some extra factors to consider perhaps

	• I am an adult male at 150lbs

	• The rate of sweat in the sauna (90 degrees Celsius sauna)

	• 1500ml of water is perhaps too much to drink within an hour of sauna time, despite that being desired on average from my body

	• Are the contents of the electrolyte powder complete enough? I've used other ones, but this one is well-priced for me

	• Average daily potassium intake for American male is at 3,016mg. Does this mean I should only have 3.5 scoops of electrolyte powder total to be at adequate amount of potassium intake of 4,700mg?

	• I don't eat fast food, but the average American sodium intake is already above daily recommendation levels

	• If my electrolyte powder is bad, what type of ingredient list would be better to look for?

1151ib0,HealthyFood,Effects of a heavy carb based diet?,"Hey I'm 21 and a broke university student. I work at a very gourmet pizza restaurant. The restaurant only uses very high quality products and makes almost all of its sauces and toppings. I of course eat plenty of free pizza and consume about 3 to 4 pizzas every week. I won't stop as it saves me plenty of money. I was wondering how healthy is this? What are the effects?

Updates:
THANK YOU ALL! So far from you have all given me these are a dot points of how to somewhat manage a diet whilst working.

Ingredients for pizza
- plenty of veg
- no cured meats such as sausage or prosciutto
- protein such as chicken
- reduce fats in general
- use sauces that have little salt or sugar in it
- pizza dough is filled with empty carbs which can cause much weight
- sometimes the actual protein and important things sometimes are little to known at fast food places.
- There will be little to none vitamins being gain from pizza or the toppings

Making and eating
- when making a pizza opt for a thinner crust
- majority should be veg
- do not have salty meals with soda and sugary drinks, real juices and water are much better
- SALADS: Pizza places may not have salads on the menu but as worker and especially if your a chef there is no reason to not swap pizza for salads. There are so many toppings which can be used to create a half decent salad. 

Outside of Work life
- All those empty carbs can creep up and create weight gain, to manage thus making sure to be active such as the gym or playing sport to burn off those excess calories
- Regain those vitamins you are missing out on",2023-02-17 23:57:03,2024-04-08 22:51:38.277033,415 days 22:54:35.277033,100,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/1151ib0/effects_of_a_heavy_carb_based_diet/

lately I heard about the many benfits of consuming blueberries daily, so I started to consume them.

I found out that buying fresh, could be almost 5 times more expensive than frozen. so I decided to buy frozen blueberries and blend them into a shake every two days roughly.

the smoothie include:

* handfull of blueberries
* milk/high protein soy milk
* sometime I add a single date
* sometimg I add protein powder

My machine is the: ""Ninja SS101 Foodi Smoothie Maker & Nutrient Extractor""

it has many settings like: ""EXTRACT"", ""SMOOTHIE"", "" SPREAD"" and ""BOAL"". i don't really understand them so I only set it to SMOOTHIE.

(the smoothie is usually high protein since I workout alot) everytime I make a smoothie I drink all of it right away, I really like and enjoy the smoothie, even more than eating the blueberries raw.

The problem is I heard that I lose many health benefits because I mix the blueberries into a smoothie. cells are being cut in the blender and some fibers are destroyed, addtionally, I heard that after blending, the exposure to oxygen cause some neutrients to escape, although I drink it right away so I guess it doesn't matter that much.

My Question Is:

What Is really lost when I blend the blueberries, health wise (do I lose vitamin E?, Antioxidants? etc) and if that lost is significant or negligible.

additionally, would you recommed to continue making those smoothies? would you suggest changing my recipe? what would you do?

10pm0g7,HealthyFood,Help with Golden Milk!!,"Okay, hopefully, I can FINALLY get this to post ***somewhere!!***

Anyways, I found a recipe online for making Golden Milk. It was something like:

1. 1tsp turmeric
2. 1tsp cinnamon
3. 2tsp local raw honey
4. 2-pinches of ground black, white, and red pepper
5. 1tsp of ground ginger
6. 1cup of A2 whole milk 

According to the recipe, this would be 2 servings. 

It said to mix ingredients and bring it to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Okay, so I did all of that; great! Now the issue... no matter *what* I tried to strain this through - I did not have cheesecloth, so that isn't something I was able to try - it would ***not*** strain. And I mean **at all!** I tried using a wet coffee filter - NOPE, it didn't work, and in fact, it was the only thing that didn't even allow a drop of liquid through! Next, I tried using a wet napkin. Again, this did not work! However, I did get a couple of drops through before it invariably stopped dripping (I even tried using a spoon to sort of pull away any of the ""clumps"" from the seasonings). The only other thing I had that I could try was a washcloth. I figured since washcloths are very porous, this would work, but because of how porous it was, I expected some of the 'seasonings' to get through into the drink, but this didn't work either!! In the end, I put a couple of wet coffee filters under the rag and sort of gently squeezed them to get what little liquid I could get from this. I ended up with less than 1/4 of a cup! 

So, my question is for anyone that has made this drink before - obviously, it may not be the exact same recipe I used as there are a crazy number of different recipes for this out there - how the hell did you manage to actually strain this so you could get more than a few drops out of the final product? I'd like to make it again, as what little I managed to get tasted pretty good, and the health benefits are pretty substantial, but there is no way I will make it again if I cannot even strain the crap! 

I want to go ahead and thank anyone that provides a solution to this problem for their time and assistance. (I also spent a long time trying to find a solution to this prior to making a post, but 99% of what I got were just damned recipes for golden milk! Thanks, search engines!!!!)",2023-01-31 02:46:10,2024-04-08 22:51:39.411469,433 days 20:05:29.411469,35,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/10pm0g7/help_with_golden_milk/

If there is maybe 3 or 4 fruits I can start buying to add into our diets that won't break the bank that would be awesome.

10a898y,HealthyFood,Ways to make cooking easier?,"I eat like shit unfortunately and I really want to change that. There are a few issues with this, though.

I have some food aversions, and quite a few leftovers are really hard for me to eat without my brain actively telling me that it's gross (even if objectively I'm enjoying the food- i.e. it tastes good, it feels good, etc, my brain will override and make me gag if it's a food that's been assigned the ""gross"" label in my brain. I'm not sure how to change this. Things like pasta or soup leftovers are not allowed in my brain.)

I make a killer soup but the prep makes it hard for me to want to make it instead of defaulting to shitty fast food. I thought about maybe taking a day to chop veggies and stuff then freezing it so I can make a soup by just throwing stuff in a pot could be good, but I'm not sure how to go about that- could that ruin the vegetables? do things like carrots, potatoes, etc freeze okay?

What are other meals that could be easy to prepare for when I want to throw everything together? I feel like chicken could be good- I sometimes will like cut some chicken and put it in individual baggies so i don't have to defrost a whole pack. That's been useful.

I'm sure the more I make cooking part of my routine the less of an issue this will be, but in the meantime I'm floundering with my health attempts.

103i40l,HealthyFood,How to stick to your 23’ healthy eating resolutions!,"Here’s simple yet effective tips to make your resolutions a lasting lifestyle. 

1. DRINK MORE WATER. When you wake up, when you want a snack, when you’re not sure if you’re actually hungry or bored. Due to primitive survival instincts our minds have a hard time distinguishing between hunger and thirst. There’s nothing healthier than water!!!

2. WILL POWER DOESNT WORK. You know who has the strongest will power ? - the people who avoid it. Don’t buy a pint of Ben and Jerry’s if you know you’ll eat it in one day. Don’t keep junk food in the house if you can’t help but binge. If I need ice cream, I buy an ice cream bar (not a tub) Know yourself, work with yourself, avoid having to use “will power”

3. AVOID PROCESSED FOODS! Is it full of preservatives? Is it ten steps away from something that grows in nature? Stay away!!! You can still be a lazy or cheap eater and keep it natural. Try nuts, eggs, canned or jarred foods. Find inspiration at your local farmers market. Check ingredients!!

4. FIND YOUR FAVORITE SEASONINGS. You don’t need to be a good cook if you have good seasoning. My favorite is Everything But The Bagel seasoning from Trader Joe’s. I put it on everything.

5. FIND JOY IN EATING HEALTHY. Make colorful dishes, thank yourself before every meal, splurge on a water bottle you love. For example, I made my morning smoothie my daily ritual. It is part of my meditation each day. I associate my healthy habit with self love!!

Good luck on your healthy food journey in 2023 everyone :)",2023-01-04 23:04:16,2024-04-08 22:51:40.183881,459 days 23:47:24.183881,72,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/103i40l/how_to_stick_to_your_23_healthy_eating_resolutions/

Currently no time to prepare my own food... Due to time management issues and , over hours so counting on what the factory serves at lunch.

Its like a Shawarma/Doner kebab rotisserie... Meat type changes between Turkey/Beef/Veal/Chicken...

I'm assuming it can be very unhealthy with so called ""Empty carbs"" Pita bread/Tortilla lots of added extra animal fat ,and various sauces...

So the plan was to eliminate all Processed empty carbs like Pita bread/Tortilla , and sauces and skip the extra added fat.

So basically Meat as lean as possible , Vegetables (Pickles ,  Cauliflower ,Cabbage, tomatoes, onions , garlic etc). And some 100% Sesame Tahini, a little here and there... 

How relatively bad/good is it in the long term to eat like that in your personal opinion? Especially if you over indulge on the meat, i guess...

102eex2,HealthyFood,"Eating healthy food is easy, giving up unhealthy food is hard","I (M26) have been blessed with a metabolism and GI track that can handle pretty much anything I throw at it (except lettuce ironically). I’ve never struggled with adverse effects of eating what I want, when I want it. For the past year though, I’ve been working hard to eat healthy alternatives. Choosing minimally processed foods, dodging PUFAs like Mike Tyson, and eating more fruits and veggies. 

My hope was that as I did this, it would become easy to just give up fast food all together. Turns out, that’s not what happened. I still get hammered with cravings for a Wendy’s burger, or Bojangles fries, or a Popeyes crispy spicy sandwich. It’s pretty much a daily thing and while I have learned not to pull into that drive through, I still feel such a powerful craving for it. 

You may think this has to do with dietary issues, maybe something I’m leaving out of my nutrient profile. I really don’t think this is the case though, because I feel full.

iyaooy,HealthyFood,/r/HealthyFood Rules - Be sure to go over this before participating in the subreddit,"Welcome to /r/HealthyFood.  This sub is for discussion of specified foods which may be considered good for us.

---

# Subreddit Content Focus

 Posts should be an examination of a specified meal and its components. See rule 4 below for specific post requirements.

**On topic:** *""Here's what I ate, what do you think of it?""*  
**Off topic:** *""What should I eat?""*

**What the subreddit focus is about** 

* **The food** - /r/HealthyFood is currently limited to posts which share a single meal and ***is for sole focus on the food*** and its nutritional content *without any other context*. Posts should be akin to the /r/food subreddit but for food with a more healthful composition. 

**What the subreddit focus is not about** 

* **The person** - The following kinds of discussion should be directed to a subreddit more directly oriented to their topics or to a health professional: diet, food naming or listing requests, health concerns, fitness, categories of foods, general nutrition, and artificial foods or supplements. 

* **Fitness, diet, or medical / health related concerns** - *Discuss your diet with a professional who, unlike participants here, can base their advice on a proper background and education, test results, your medical history, and your eating trends / habits / issues*

* **Bashing on others** - DO NOT bash people for questions about specific foods / food items, or not consuming something to your standard of perfection

* **Activism or crusading** - It's fine to have a preference. Be diverse in your participation. Being an argument looking for a place to happen is not okay. Hyperbolic or inflammatory engagement is not okay


---

# Educate, don't berate

**Keep your cool and maintain perspective. Assume people are here to learn. Offer advice and counter opinions respectfully and include links to support your claims.**

People are here to learn - They do so by asking about their food, their recipe improvement attempts, and the science as they understand it (which may or may not be accurate). If you see something offered or stated which you don't believe to be ""healthy"" or factual, rather than get angry at them, respond to offer info with sources

People are built different and have different needs - Everybody is not the same and that's okay. People come in a variety of shapes, needs, and points of view.  What may be good for you may not be ideal for someone else

Getting shitty isn't going to help - How angry / right / informative you think you are is never an exception from the rules.  Being a dick does not succeed in anything except you coming across like a dick. It doesn't change minds or get anyone to consider your point.  Walk away if you are upset.  Report it if something violates the rules

---

# The Rules of /r/HealthyFood

The rule titles below are sufficient for 99.999% of participants. Most of this is to deal with spammers and those with food based anger issues.  Unfortunately, the added detail for each rule has made this lengthy. Thank all the rule lawyers and bad actors out there who made it necessary


### 1)  [Reddiquette+](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) is required. Don't be a dick

* Disagreements are fine but personal attacks and insults are not. Trolling, insults, or antagonism towards participants, moderators, or even the community itself will result in a ban
* No witch hunts or vote complaining
* No complaint posts or comments about this or any other subreddit.  Use modmail to discuss concerns about rules and moderation
* Don't make generalizations about the subreddit or participants - It's not backed by actual data and is rarely accurate.  Don't go there just because others did not emphatically agree or vote your way
* Avoid rude non-constructive comments - don't call someone's food disgusting, gross, or make any other non-constructive criticisms
* If you claim something is unhealthy, do so respectfully and provide a source (with links)^*
* Food / Diet / Portion shaming is not allowed - Assumptions, especially by shamers, are frequently wrong. People don't all have the same goals.  A picture may show something that is a rare treat or meant for more than one. Food images here often contain swaps for healthier ingredients but are meant to appear as something else. Don't assume, ask. Don't shame.



### 2) No dietary activism / crusading

Presenting a food based POV is fine as long as it is done *respectfully* and abides by the rules. Diet wars and diet crusading are NOT welcome in this subreddit. Being a diet fan is fine. Being either a jerk diet fan or anti-fan is not okay. DO NOT;

* **engage disrespectfully towards other diets / beliefs** - It's fine to disagree. Be informative without being rude
* **engage in diet crusading or food shaming** - instead, post an example of what you think is good
* **downvote due to someone's diet preference**
* **promote or argue ethics and morals** - this is often intended to be inflammatory or to shame. It is always off topic from the focus of this subreddit as morality and ethical labels do not change the nutritional aspects of food items.
* **promote diet absolutism** - your preferred diet is not the only healthy one. You CAN say ""it is best for me"" and explain what your favorite food approach emphasizes nutritionally.
* **make specious claims** - claiming a diet cures a chronic illness is not allowed.  Saying it ""can control the symptoms of"" is fine if that is truly the case but sources should be cited
* **engage in pitchforking or brigading** - towards any subreddit, its posts, or comments
* **bias whine** - ""I'm downvoted because I'm (name food POV)"" is just shit stirring and a hollow attempt at playing victim / martyr
* **excessively advertise a diet based subreddit** - avoid promoting a related sub no more than 1/10 of your activity

### 3) No self-promotion

This sub is under constant bombardment from spammers and self-promoters.  The moderators do not have the time to be wishy washy about this. **Any violation of this rule will result in a ban**

You may not post or comment here to discuss, link to, or include content from anything you are affiliated with, including; your works, service, product, app, article, blog, site, youtube or other video, survey, market research, funding drive, social media account, etc. Accounts showing up here with descriptions or history involving spam or promotion may be banned.

### 4) Post requirements

* **ALL posts require an approval process** 
* **Required post type and focus** - Posts must be an image of a single meal and will require an added info comment for approval (refer to the directions message sent to you after submitting the post). *The post's sole focus must be on the food itself, the single meal depicted.* 
* **Post context NOT allowed** - it may not include any context regarding personal food habits or goals, requests to list or name foods, diet, what's *bad* for you, fitness, medical concerns, health issues, cure claims, artificial food, or supplements. No Meta content (use modmail)
* **Image restrictions** - A single meal image only. No video, memes, screencaps, product or nutrition labels, other images with text. or any kind of placeholder image
* **Spam and promotion** - ZERO tolerance. ZERO chance of being approved and *will only result in a ban*. Do not link to or submit content from your own site, blog, video channel, social media, etc.
* **Add the required info comment** - After you submit the post, the following info must then be added to the comment section for post approval  

   > > **Name:** (name of the meal depicted)  
   > > **Macro / micro nutrient focus:** (Identify at least 2 which are abundant or minimal in the food shown. Naming categories of foods or diet types does not qualify)  
   > > **Ingredients list or Recipe:**  (what's in it or how do you make it)

### 5) No YouTube or other video

Due to the *extremely* high rate of YouTube and other video content sharing here being spam, off-topic, or having gross misinformation, all links and refences to YouTube and other video sources are no longer allowed and will be removed. Don't share, show, link, discuss, or identify videos / channels. Attempting to end run the rule via any means may result in a ban. *We mean it. No youtube or other video.*

### 6) New, low karma, and underage accounts are restricted

* Accounts which are new - May not post. Can participate in the comments. Spend a few weeks getting to know reddit and the sub before posting 
* Accounts with low / no karma - May not post. Can participate in the comments   
* Accounts with negative karma - May not post. Accounts with more than a little negative karma may not comment  
* Accounts by minors - May not post or make any form of dietary advice requests. *Do not give dietary advice to those under 18*  

*Note: Account age and karma amounts change periodically based on spam control needs*

### ...and that may not cover everything

Though extremely rare, posts and comments may be removed and accounts may be banned at moderator discretion for reasons other than those stated in the rules. It is not possible to provide a rule for every potential problem. For example, there is no rule regarding nuclear secrets yet we would not allow posts or comments about them in the sub. The best advice we can offer on this is; Don't be a dick in any way

## About user flair

In order to encourage comment participants to use and give heavier consideration to sourced claims, automod will set a user's flair to 'cites source' for a user when they include a link to any source in their last top level comment here (a top level comment is a response to the post, not to another comment)

---

## About modmails and appeals

Nearly without exception, removals, bans, and modmails about confusion are a result of skipping or skimming  rules and notices.

We currently have *less than* 3 human mods for a sub of over 3 million subscribers.  Spam requires most of our volunteer resources. We simply don't have spare time to wade in the mud of bad faith engagement.

*When modmailing, bad faith interaction, especially being dishonest, disingenuous, rude, antagonistic, or indignant, will always be counter productive and dead ends conversation.* Instead, be honest, straightforward, aware of the rules, and have self-awareness if you violated them. If you have a heated chip on your shoulder, take a breath before responding.

Things that are not a consideration for appeals; votes, what other people or subs do, your intent, what something costs, the amount of help / info you think you can provide, opinions of the rules, your favorite sweater, etc. Following the rules, being topical, or otherwise going out bounds are the only considerations

**Before appealing a removal** 

Read removal notices, rules, and posting page notices. Removal notices provide the reason and state your options. 

**Before appealing a ban** - 

* take a breath and be civil, understand any antagonism or other bad faith engagement will end discussion
* read communications to you from the mod team including automod. The ban notice states the ban reason and provides a link to relevant context (more than one comment or post may be involved)
* ban discussion and appeals are only handled via a response to the ban message. Do not create new modmail chains to discuss your ban 
* requests for an immediate undoing of a ban because you are new or suddenly found awareness of rules and notices will NOT be granted. There is ample heads up about the rules and the need to follow them.  There are no free passes.


---

## Moderators needed

We'd like to add about a dozen moderators. Working to make a positive place means dealing with the negatives so this is not 'fun'. You have to deal with pests and weeds and put in work regularly to have a great garden.  If you want to help, have more than a year of history on reddit, can offer a little time every day, and aren't a dietary crusader, send us a modmail and ask about joining the mod team.

^* About ""that's unhealthy"" comments - If you have a differing opinion from the poster or others in the comments about what is healthy, it's fine to disagree provided you A) help them understand your view by backing the claim with links to sources and B) avoid being rude about it in any way. Nobody is censoring you and in fact, we are striving for the opposite. *We want you to effectively get your point across*. We want people to learn from each other and to do so it should be a discussion based on science, not ""because I said so"", which is why we require the citation links. You get to give an opinion backed by facts and help others understand your point when you add links to sources. It is positive and productive and has an actual chance of convincing others to look at it from your perspective. It also gives the other party a chance to examine what you are basing your belief on and counter any possible misunderstandings you might have. Just commenting ""that's unhealthy"" is rude and does jack shit.",2020-09-23 14:01:41,2024-04-08 22:52:14.025660,1293 days 08:50:33.025661,5,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/iyaooy/rhealthyfood_rules_be_sure_to_go_over_this_before/
1baf9ar,HealthyFood,"The r/HealthyFood Help and Info Pantry Post March, 2024 - Ask general nutrition and diet related questions here","**The front page of this sub** is for sharing posts of specific / specified food, akin to the food subreddit, but for food which may be considered to be more healthful. The focus is solely on the food, its ingredient and nutritional composition, noting any recipe changes made for macro / micro adjustment.

**This pinned community post** is, at this time, for anything that is not a meal share image post, and is especially meant for questions regarding general nutrition, diet, and other personal context related queries

Participants here should:

* be human
* keep it civil
* strive to educate
* reference science / peer reviewed sources
* avoid assumptions about ingredients, serving sizes, the poster, and their diet

Participants here should not:

* berate, antagonize, inflame, or attack others
* attack or berate others for not knowing what they don't know
* spam or promote
* add context of any kind involving a health concern
* crusade or engage disrespectfully for or against any approach to food
* reference social media as a source
* add images or video
* engage in meta discussion, subreddit or account callouts, or brigading 

***Please take giving health and diet advice seriously, be careful and appropriate about it***

There is no singular magic diet for everyone on the planet. People have varying dietary needs / goals depending on physical condition, health issues, age, goals, and dietary and activity history. A 325 lb college freshman linebacker, an 85 lb underweight adult or pre-teen, and a diabetic have differing needs. 

Avoid *always* scenarios, assumptions, and generalizations. Bashing on others demanding some macro / micro is all bad or all great for every person on the planet is unrealistic and not the way to discuss food nutritive content here.

Lastly and most important, for those seeking advice here about personal diet (and those trying to sneak in health concerns), proper and accurate advice involves;

* testing to establish current values, tracking over time, and impacts from changes
* examination of medical and family history
* examination of dietary history and activity
* an accredited professional, fully and properly educated, keeping up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. This will always be many times over more accurate and safe than resorting to 1) anonymous strangers who most often are not specialists or educated on the topic 2) people who do not have the proper info to advise you for your specific circumstance and 3) the horrid but realistic possibility that anonymous uninformed sources may either unintentionally or, sadly worse, intentionally give harmful advice 

Without these things, any of the blind advice you receive may not only be wrong, it can even be dangerous.

There is no singular magic diet for everyone on the planet. People have varying dietary needs / goals depending on physical condition, health issues, age, goals, and dietary and activity history. A 325 lb college freshman linebacker, an 85 lb underweight adult or pre-teen, and a diabetic have differing needs. 

Avoid *always* scenarios, assumptions, and generalizations. Bashing on others demanding some macro / micro is all bad or all great for every person on the planet is unrealistic and not the way to discuss food nutritive content here.

Lastly and most important, for those seeking advice here about personal diet (and those trying to sneak in health concerns), proper and accurate advice involves;

* testing to establish current values, tracking over time, and impacts from changes
* examination of medical and family history
* examination of dietary history and activity
* an accredited professional, fully and properly educated, keeping up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. This will always be many times over more accurate and safe than resorting to 1) anonymous strangers who most often are not specialists or educated on the topic 2) people who do not have the proper info to advise you for your specific circumstance and 3) the horrid but realistic possibility that anonymous uninformed sources may either unintentionally or, sadly worse, intentionally give harmful advice

There is no singular magic diet for everyone on the planet. People have varying dietary needs / goals depending on physical condition, health issues, age, goals, and dietary and activity history. A 325 lb college freshman linebacker, an 85 lb underweight adult or pre-teen, and a diabetic have differing needs. 

Avoid *always* scenarios, assumptions, and generalizations. Bashing on others demanding some macro / micro is all bad or all great for every person on the planet is unrealistic and not the way to discuss food nutritive content here.

Lastly and most important, for those seeking advice here about personal diet (and those trying to sneak in health concerns), proper and accurate advice involves;

* testing to establish current values, tracking over time, and impacts from changes
* examination of medical and family history
* examination of dietary history and activity
* an accredited professional, fully and properly educated, keeping up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. This will always be many times over more accurate and safe than resorting to 1) anonymous strangers who most often are not specialists or educated on the topic 2) people who do not have the proper info to advise you for your specific circumstance and 3) the horrid but realistic possibility that anonymous uninformed sources may either unintentionally or, sadly worse, intentionally give harmful advice

16eexad,HealthyFood,r/HealthyFood subreddit update - Post changes,"Hi,

## The problem

Posts are getting a bit outside the scope of the sub more frequently. These kinds of posts consistently involve critical information gaps by posters and responders. There is also a problem of not having enough moderators for a sub of this size (we'll cover that concern at the end). Therefore, some key changes will be made to this subreddit in order to get things back to center for its topic, focus, and purpose.

The misunderstanding some are having about this sub is like confusing a cat subreddit for a pet subreddit. A cat is a pet but the cat sub is not the right sub for dog questions. We're getting the equivalent of a LOT of dog questions, lizard questions, snake questions, rabbit cage design questions, etc. 

Some people, most often site and sub newcomers, are getting confused and even angry that this sub isn't an anything-ever-possibly-related-to-food sub. 

**What the sub is:** It's for focus on the food itself, specific food, a meal the poster wants to share and get info and opinions on. This sub was founded as a sibling to the food subreddit where posters share food they've had, but here it also focuses on the meal's content and composition, including any ingredient changes made to improve nutritional value, increased or reduced macro / micro values (note the use of *improve*, not *achieved perfection*).

**What the sub is not:** a general nutrition, diet, and health concern consultation forum. The focus needs to get back to being food / specific meal centric, not overarching personal diet, broad food categories, or general nutrition centric.

**You can consult more than one friend / source:** For some questions, another sub may be the better option and that's a good thing. There are several great subreddits which specifically focus on the topic of diet, budget, fitness, general nutrition, and combinations thereof. For example, /r/eatcheapandhealthy and /r/nutrition are great subs related to food and nutrition, each with their own focus, Please add the power of other subs to your info arsenal and enjoy conversing there too with the people who are dedicated to discussing those topics.

*EDIT - Another reason why this sub needs to focus solely on the food and not the person is there is an inherent problem with diet, health concern, and personal context related posts on reddit which is far more concerning than being outside the intent of the sub: The reality is that without these things, which are never provided and would be too personal to do so here, responses are blind guesses that have more than a small possibility of being wrong and can even be dangerous: proper testing, medical history, activity patterns, family history, and an evaluation from an accredited professional who is fully and properly educated in their specialization staying up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. Whereas what happens here is 1) an anonymous person with no accountability will be making wild guesses 2) based on extremely limited and incomplete information provided about the personal scenario and 3) the advice provided tends to be an assessment based on a couple of skimming glances of semi related social media posts sometimes rising to paraphrasing of studies except often done poorly. Responders are very rarely offering links to studies or proper sources of information. This is even before we get to the problem of trolls pretending to be professionals and worse, scumbags who intentionally and maliciously give dangerous advice. No offense folks since we all know the person asking and the vast majority of people answering mean well but this information shortfall from all angles resulting in blind guesswork with more than a small potential for being off the mark is the reality behind the advice going on for these kinds of posts on reddit.*

Now for a short non-commercial break from the heaviness of this topic, ala derp cats https://redd.it/16e9cb1  
...and back to the program...

## Changes to this sub

**Front page posts** - Going forward, this subreddit will be returning to its founding purpose. Front page posts will be limited to ""here's the healthful food I ate"" type image posts. The current added info comment requirement for food image posts will remain in place so participants get ingredient / recipe info as well as macro / micro notes for the food shown. **Text posts will be off the board until enough volunteers have joined the mod team to keep up with them**. 

**The promotion post** - this is going away. The sub will simply no longer allow spam / promotion anywhere in the forum.

**A new weekly pinned info / help request post (starting Monday)** - We don't like people getting confused or angry for wanting help while misunderstanding and being road blocked for it. Therefore, this pinned post will be provided for those who want to ask things here which are food related but are tangential to the sub purpose. These kinds of queries include;

* anything diet oriented - requests for diet analysis, food / drink suggestions, evaluations, ""how much"", ""too much"", ""is this bad for me?"" etc. 
* general nutrition and food category queries - broad food groups like ""dairy"", ""meat"", ""vegetables"", ""melons"", etc. rather than single meal specific
* and for now, anything else that would've been a text post, anything which isn't about a single specific meal with an image of the food shared for discussion
* Note: queries with any context involving a health issue, concern, diagnosis, treatment, etc. will continue to be out of bounds for this sub and will be auto removed (refer to a professional)


We want folks to get their desired info / discussion pertaining to food but we need the sub front page to be clear at a glance what its purpose / topic is so newcomer confusion is kept to a minimum. 

We should have made adjustments when the sub hit major growth, putting topical guardrails in place to prevent the deviation from getting to the level it has. Apologies for that, we've been busy with other mod needs (see below). Taking the steps now to restrict the front page to the sub purpose and adding a weekly (or more frequent) info / help discussion post for food related queries seems to be the best way to get things back on track.

## Moderator help is urgently needed

We have only three active human moderators for a sub of over 3 million subscribers. Because of poorly thought out changes by the site regarding third party apps, our bot help has recently been crippled. For years, we've been way beyond the point of needing more volunteers for the mod team and we're at a breaking point.

Pretty much all our volunteer time is taken up dealing with spammers / scammers. The ratio of spam to legit content here is unusually high compared to other subs. As for the non-spam posts, we simply don't have the eyeball resources to analyze every text post for topical relevance or time to debate it. To open the sub up to other kinds of posts again isn't going to be realistic without bringing additional mod volunteers on board.

Volunteers with moderating experience would be great but we're happy to give pointers to those who are new to it.

Things you need to know if you want to mod: Scammers go to amazing lengths. Bot / AI engagement here is going on much more than you think. People can get to ugly mode fast and some are dangerous. The issues which have to be addressed rarely are just what they seem on the surface so you'll have to enjoy detective work. Site admin support is really bad and claims regarding their efforts tend to prove hollow. Yes, it can get bad like kids pretending to be doctors while intentionally giving malicious advice for funsies or a pervert posting to the person they're stalking their desire to violently hurt the child target (yep, it happened here and site admin refused to help or even talk to us about it). Moderating is not glorious. Shit gets (un)real

16cxhg8,HealthyFood,"Butter, Margarine vs Table spread","Hi all! Really appreciate your professional feedback on this matter.

Throughout my entire life, I’ve been told that butter is healthier compared to Margarine but recently I’ve found out that Butter actually contains higher fat (HDL/LDL) compared to Margarine (80%). 

Now the question is, is this really true? 

Also, looking back at the matter, I discovered the table spreads (not in my home country), which is advertised lower in fat compared to Margarine. 

Again, is this true?

Looking at the ingredients, 99% they say vegetable oil include yet the evidence suggests the so called vegetable oil is the palm oil (which most are saying bad for health). 

Appreciate your support.

Ps. Which one is the healthiest?

Many thanks!",2023-09-08 01:55:05,2024-04-08 22:52:14.984925,213 days 20:57:09.984925,36,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/16cxhg8/butter_margarine_vs_table_spread/

I consume a fair bit of milk directly and by making yogurt. I also enjoy using cream and butter in cooking and eating.

162s54j,HealthyFood,Beet Jerky: any brands or flavors that don’t taste like mulch?,"I’ve been hearing a lot about how nutritious beets are, and that there’s this product called “beet jerky”. Now I love a good food pun (chick’n nuggets anyone?), I love jerky, but I’m not really a beet fan. But if you can turn it into a jerky-like product and flavor it up with pepper or garlic how bad it could be?

So I tried sesame-ginger teriyaki beet jerky. I broke off a small piece, reminded myself it’s not really beef jerky, and ate it. 

I can only describe the flavor and mouthfeel as raked up wet leaves. It was awful. I couldn’t taste sesame, ginger, or teriyaki, just this earthy flavor with beet undertones that required quite a bit of chewing before I could force it down. I couldn’t bring myself to try another bite. 

I wasn’t expecting it to taste like beef jerky but I was hoping it would at least be palatable. 

Again, I’m not really a beet fan so maybe this is impossible, it’s just not for me. But I’m hoping there’s a product out there that isn’t this bad. 

Has anyone found a brand or flavor that you actually enjoy?",2023-08-27 14:40:04,2024-04-08 22:52:14.985044,225 days 08:12:10.985045,20,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/162s54j/beet_jerky_any_brands_or_flavors_that_dont_taste/

What I've managed to find and read thus far is quite technical and easily over my head. Among all of the junk articles, the most informative one has been [this](https://examine.com/guides/protein-intake/). Some ways down it mentions the combining of protein sources (isolates) for better efficiency, for example rice and soy, which was my intention.

Now given that I've sorted out what my daily intake of protein has to be, what is the ratio of one protein to another? How do you go about finding that out?

And also does the math change if you use raw ingredients?

iyaooy,HealthyFood,/r/HealthyFood Rules - Be sure to go over this before participating in the subreddit,"Welcome to /r/HealthyFood.  This sub is for discussion of specified foods which may be considered good for us.

---

# Subreddit Content Focus

 Posts should be an examination of a specified meal and its components. See rule 4 below for specific post requirements.

**On topic:** *""Here's what I ate, what do you think of it?""*  
**Off topic:** *""What should I eat?""*

**What the subreddit focus is about** 

* **The food** - /r/HealthyFood is currently limited to posts which share a single meal and ***is for sole focus on the food*** and its nutritional content *without any other context*. Posts should be akin to the /r/food subreddit but for food with a more healthful composition. 

**What the subreddit focus is not about** 

* **The person** - The following kinds of discussion should be directed to a subreddit more directly oriented to their topics or to a health professional: diet, food naming or listing requests, health concerns, fitness, categories of foods, general nutrition, and artificial foods or supplements. 

* **Fitness, diet, or medical / health related concerns** - *Discuss your diet with a professional who, unlike participants here, can base their advice on a proper background and education, test results, your medical history, and your eating trends / habits / issues*

* **Bashing on others** - DO NOT bash people for questions about specific foods / food items, or not consuming something to your standard of perfection

* **Activism or crusading** - It's fine to have a preference. Be diverse in your participation. Being an argument looking for a place to happen is not okay. Hyperbolic or inflammatory engagement is not okay


---

# Educate, don't berate

**Keep your cool and maintain perspective. Assume people are here to learn. Offer advice and counter opinions respectfully and include links to support your claims.**

People are here to learn - They do so by asking about their food, their recipe improvement attempts, and the science as they understand it (which may or may not be accurate). If you see something offered or stated which you don't believe to be ""healthy"" or factual, rather than get angry at them, respond to offer info with sources

People are built different and have different needs - Everybody is not the same and that's okay. People come in a variety of shapes, needs, and points of view.  What may be good for you may not be ideal for someone else

Getting shitty isn't going to help - How angry / right / informative you think you are is never an exception from the rules.  Being a dick does not succeed in anything except you coming across like a dick. It doesn't change minds or get anyone to consider your point.  Walk away if you are upset.  Report it if something violates the rules

---

# The Rules of /r/HealthyFood

The rule titles below are sufficient for 99.999% of participants. Most of this is to deal with spammers and those with food based anger issues.  Unfortunately, the added detail for each rule has made this lengthy. Thank all the rule lawyers and bad actors out there who made it necessary


### 1)  [Reddiquette+](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) is required. Don't be a dick

* Disagreements are fine but personal attacks and insults are not. Trolling, insults, or antagonism towards participants, moderators, or even the community itself will result in a ban
* No witch hunts or vote complaining
* No complaint posts or comments about this or any other subreddit.  Use modmail to discuss concerns about rules and moderation
* Don't make generalizations about the subreddit or participants - It's not backed by actual data and is rarely accurate.  Don't go there just because others did not emphatically agree or vote your way
* Avoid rude non-constructive comments - don't call someone's food disgusting, gross, or make any other non-constructive criticisms
* If you claim something is unhealthy, do so respectfully and provide a source (with links)^*
* Food / Diet / Portion shaming is not allowed - Assumptions, especially by shamers, are frequently wrong. People don't all have the same goals.  A picture may show something that is a rare treat or meant for more than one. Food images here often contain swaps for healthier ingredients but are meant to appear as something else. Don't assume, ask. Don't shame.



### 2) No dietary activism / crusading

Presenting a food based POV is fine as long as it is done *respectfully* and abides by the rules. Diet wars and diet crusading are NOT welcome in this subreddit. Being a diet fan is fine. Being either a jerk diet fan or anti-fan is not okay. DO NOT;

* **engage disrespectfully towards other diets / beliefs** - It's fine to disagree. Be informative without being rude
* **engage in diet crusading or food shaming** - instead, post an example of what you think is good
* **downvote due to someone's diet preference**
* **promote or argue ethics and morals** - this is often intended to be inflammatory or to shame. It is always off topic from the focus of this subreddit as morality and ethical labels do not change the nutritional aspects of food items.
* **promote diet absolutism** - your preferred diet is not the only healthy one. You CAN say ""it is best for me"" and explain what your favorite food approach emphasizes nutritionally.
* **make specious claims** - claiming a diet cures a chronic illness is not allowed.  Saying it ""can control the symptoms of"" is fine if that is truly the case but sources should be cited
* **engage in pitchforking or brigading** - towards any subreddit, its posts, or comments
* **bias whine** - ""I'm downvoted because I'm (name food POV)"" is just shit stirring and a hollow attempt at playing victim / martyr
* **excessively advertise a diet based subreddit** - avoid promoting a related sub no more than 1/10 of your activity

### 3) No self-promotion

This sub is under constant bombardment from spammers and self-promoters.  The moderators do not have the time to be wishy washy about this. **Any violation of this rule will result in a ban**

You may not post or comment here to discuss, link to, or include content from anything you are affiliated with, including; your works, service, product, app, article, blog, site, youtube or other video, survey, market research, funding drive, social media account, etc. Accounts showing up here with descriptions or history involving spam or promotion may be banned.

### 4) Post requirements

* **ALL posts require an approval process** 
* **Required post type and focus** - Posts must be an image of a single meal and will require an added info comment for approval (refer to the directions message sent to you after submitting the post). *The post's sole focus must be on the food itself, the single meal depicted.* 
* **Post context NOT allowed** - it may not include any context regarding personal food habits or goals, requests to list or name foods, diet, what's *bad* for you, fitness, medical concerns, health issues, cure claims, artificial food, or supplements. No Meta content (use modmail)
* **Image restrictions** - A single meal image only. No video, memes, screencaps, product or nutrition labels, other images with text. or any kind of placeholder image
* **Spam and promotion** - ZERO tolerance. ZERO chance of being approved and *will only result in a ban*. Do not link to or submit content from your own site, blog, video channel, social media, etc.
* **Add the required info comment** - After you submit the post, the following info must then be added to the comment section for post approval  

   > > **Name:** (name of the meal depicted)  
   > > **Macro / micro nutrient focus:** (Identify at least 2 which are abundant or minimal in the food shown. Naming categories of foods or diet types does not qualify)  
   > > **Ingredients list or Recipe:**  (what's in it or how do you make it)

### 5) No YouTube or other video

Due to the *extremely* high rate of YouTube and other video content sharing here being spam, off-topic, or having gross misinformation, all links and refences to YouTube and other video sources are no longer allowed and will be removed. Don't share, show, link, discuss, or identify videos / channels. Attempting to end run the rule via any means may result in a ban. *We mean it. No youtube or other video.*

### 6) New, low karma, and underage accounts are restricted

* Accounts which are new - May not post. Can participate in the comments. Spend a few weeks getting to know reddit and the sub before posting 
* Accounts with low / no karma - May not post. Can participate in the comments   
* Accounts with negative karma - May not post. Accounts with more than a little negative karma may not comment  
* Accounts by minors - May not post or make any form of dietary advice requests. *Do not give dietary advice to those under 18*  

*Note: Account age and karma amounts change periodically based on spam control needs*

### ...and that may not cover everything

Though extremely rare, posts and comments may be removed and accounts may be banned at moderator discretion for reasons other than those stated in the rules. It is not possible to provide a rule for every potential problem. For example, there is no rule regarding nuclear secrets yet we would not allow posts or comments about them in the sub. The best advice we can offer on this is; Don't be a dick in any way

## About user flair

In order to encourage comment participants to use and give heavier consideration to sourced claims, automod will set a user's flair to 'cites source' for a user when they include a link to any source in their last top level comment here (a top level comment is a response to the post, not to another comment)

---

## About modmails and appeals

Nearly without exception, removals, bans, and modmails about confusion are a result of skipping or skimming  rules and notices.

We currently have *less than* 3 human mods for a sub of over 3 million subscribers.  Spam requires most of our volunteer resources. We simply don't have spare time to wade in the mud of bad faith engagement.

*When modmailing, bad faith interaction, especially being dishonest, disingenuous, rude, antagonistic, or indignant, will always be counter productive and dead ends conversation.* Instead, be honest, straightforward, aware of the rules, and have self-awareness if you violated them. If you have a heated chip on your shoulder, take a breath before responding.

Things that are not a consideration for appeals; votes, what other people or subs do, your intent, what something costs, the amount of help / info you think you can provide, opinions of the rules, your favorite sweater, etc. Following the rules, being topical, or otherwise going out bounds are the only considerations

**Before appealing a removal** 

Read removal notices, rules, and posting page notices. Removal notices provide the reason and state your options. 

**Before appealing a ban** - 

* take a breath and be civil, understand any antagonism or other bad faith engagement will end discussion
* read communications to you from the mod team including automod. The ban notice states the ban reason and provides a link to relevant context (more than one comment or post may be involved)
* ban discussion and appeals are only handled via a response to the ban message. Do not create new modmail chains to discuss your ban 
* requests for an immediate undoing of a ban because you are new or suddenly found awareness of rules and notices will NOT be granted. There is ample heads up about the rules and the need to follow them.  There are no free passes.


---

## Moderators needed

We'd like to add about a dozen moderators. Working to make a positive place means dealing with the negatives so this is not 'fun'. You have to deal with pests and weeds and put in work regularly to have a great garden.  If you want to help, have more than a year of history on reddit, can offer a little time every day, and aren't a dietary crusader, send us a modmail and ask about joining the mod team.

---

^* About ""that's unhealthy"" comments - If you have a differing opinion from the poster or others in the comments about what is healthy, it's fine to disagree provided you A) help them understand your view by backing the claim with links to sources and B) avoid being rude about it in any way. Nobody is censoring you and in fact, we are striving for the opposite. *We want you to effectively get your point across*. We want people to learn from each other and to do so it should be a discussion based on science, not ""because I said so"", which is why we require the citation links. You get to give an opinion backed by facts and help others understand your point when you add links to sources. It is positive and productive and has an actual chance of convincing others to look at it from your perspective. It also gives the other party a chance to examine what you are basing your belief on and counter any possible misunderstandings you might have. Just commenting ""that's unhealthy"" is rude and does jack shit.",2020-09-23 14:01:41,2024-04-15 01:24:39.180852,1299 days 11:22:58.180853,5,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/iyaooy/rhealthyfood_rules_be_sure_to_go_over_this_before/
1bzobxe,HealthyFood,"The r/HealthyFood Help and Info Pantry Post April, 2024 - Ask general nutrition and diet related questions here","**The front page of this sub** is for sharing posts of specific / specified food, akin to the food subreddit, but for food which may be considered to be more healthful. The focus is solely on the food, its ingredient and nutritional composition, noting any recipe changes made for macro / micro adjustment.

**This pinned community post** is, at this time, for anything that is not a meal share image post, and is especially meant for questions regarding general nutrition, diet, and other personal context related queries

Participants here should:

* be human
* keep it civil
* strive to educate
* reference science / peer reviewed sources
* avoid assumptions about ingredients, serving sizes, the poster, and their diet

Participants here should not:

* berate, antagonize, inflame, or attack others
* attack or berate others for not knowing what they don't know
* spam or promote
* add context of any kind involving a health concern
* crusade or engage disrespectfully for or against any approach to food
* reference social media as a source
* add images or video
* engage in meta discussion, subreddit or account callouts, or brigading 

***Please take giving health and diet advice seriously, be careful and appropriate about it***

There is no singular magic diet for everyone on the planet. People have varying dietary needs / goals depending on physical condition, health issues, age, goals, and dietary and activity history. A 325 lb college freshman linebacker, an 85 lb underweight adult or pre-teen, and a diabetic have differing needs. 

Avoid *always* scenarios, assumptions, and generalizations. Bashing on others demanding some macro / micro is all bad or all great for every person on the planet is unrealistic and not the way to discuss food nutritive content here.

Lastly and most important, for those seeking advice here about personal diet (and those trying to sneak in health concerns), proper and accurate advice involves;

* testing to establish current values, tracking over time, and impacts from changes
* examination of medical and family history
* examination of dietary history and activity
* an accredited professional, fully and properly educated, keeping up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. This will always be many times over more accurate and safe than resorting to 1) anonymous strangers who most often are not specialists or educated on the topic 2) people who do not have the proper info to advise you for your specific circumstance and 3) the horrid but realistic possibility that anonymous uninformed sources may either unintentionally or, sadly worse, intentionally give harmful advice 

Without these things, any of the blind advice you receive may not only be wrong, it can even be dangerous.

There is no singular magic diet for everyone on the planet. People have varying dietary needs / goals depending on physical condition, health issues, age, goals, and dietary and activity history. A 325 lb college freshman linebacker, an 85 lb underweight adult or pre-teen, and a diabetic have differing needs. 

Avoid *always* scenarios, assumptions, and generalizations. Bashing on others demanding some macro / micro is all bad or all great for every person on the planet is unrealistic and not the way to discuss food nutritive content here.

Lastly and most important, for those seeking advice here about personal diet (and those trying to sneak in health concerns), proper and accurate advice involves;

* testing to establish current values, tracking over time, and impacts from changes
* examination of medical and family history
* examination of dietary history and activity

This will always be many times over more accurate and safe than resorting to 1) anonymous strangers who most often are not specialists or educated on the topic 2) people who do not have the proper info to advise you for your specific circumstance and 3) the horrid but realistic possibility that anonymous uninformed sources may either unintentionally or, sadly worse, intentionally give harmful advice

There is no singular magic diet for everyone on the planet. People have varying dietary needs / goals depending on physical condition, health issues, age, goals, and dietary and activity history. A 325 lb college freshman linebacker, an 85 lb underweight adult or pre-teen, and a diabetic have differing needs. 

Avoid *always* scenarios, assumptions, and generalizations. Bashing on others demanding some macro / micro is all bad or all great for every person on the planet is unrealistic and not the way to discuss food nutritive content here.

Lastly and most important, for those seeking advice here about personal diet (and those trying to sneak in health concerns), proper and accurate advice involves;

* testing to establish current values, tracking over time, and impacts from changes
* examination of medical and family history
* examination of dietary history and activity

This will always be many times over more accurate and safe than resorting to 1) anonymous strangers who most often are not specialists or educated on the topic 2) people who do not have the proper info to advise you for your specific circumstance and 3) the horrid but realistic possibility that anonymous uninformed sources may either unintentionally or, sadly worse, intentionally give harmful advice

16eexad,HealthyFood,r/HealthyFood subreddit update - Post changes,"Hi,

## The problem

Posts are getting a bit outside the scope of the sub more frequently. These kinds of posts consistently involve critical information gaps by posters and responders. There is also a problem of not having enough moderators for a sub of this size (we'll cover that concern at the end). Therefore, some key changes will be made to this subreddit in order to get things back to center for its topic, focus, and purpose.

The misunderstanding some are having about this sub is like confusing a cat subreddit for a pet subreddit. A cat is a pet but the cat sub is not the right sub for dog questions. We're getting the equivalent of a LOT of dog questions, lizard questions, snake questions, rabbit cage design questions, etc. 

Some people, most often site and sub newcomers, are getting confused and even angry that this sub isn't an anything-ever-possibly-related-to-food sub. 

**What the sub is:** It's for focus on the food itself, specific food, a meal the poster wants to share and get info and opinions on. This sub was founded as a sibling to the food subreddit where posters share food they've had, but here it also focuses on the meal's content and composition, including any ingredient changes made to improve nutritional value, increased or reduced macro / micro values (note the use of *improve*, not *achieved perfection*).

**What the sub is not:** a general nutrition, diet, and health concern consultation forum. The focus needs to get back to being food / specific meal centric, not overarching personal diet, broad food categories, or general nutrition centric.

**You can consult more than one friend / source:** For some questions, another sub may be the better option and that's a good thing. There are several great subreddits which specifically focus on the topic of diet, budget, fitness, general nutrition, and combinations thereof. For example, /r/eatcheapandhealthy and /r/nutrition are great subs related to food and nutrition, each with their own focus, Please add the power of other subs to your info arsenal and enjoy conversing there too with the people who are dedicated to discussing those topics.

*EDIT - Another reason why this sub needs to focus solely on the food and not the person is there is an inherent problem with diet, health concern, and personal context related posts on reddit which is far more concerning than being outside the intent of the sub: The reality is that without these things, which are never provided and would be too personal to do so here, responses are blind guesses that have more than a small possibility of being wrong and can even be dangerous: proper testing, medical history, activity patterns, family history, and an evaluation from an accredited professional who is fully and properly educated in their specialization staying up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. Whereas what happens here is 1) an anonymous person with no accountability will be making wild guesses 2) based on extremely limited and incomplete information provided about the personal scenario and 3) the advice provided tends to be an assessment based on a couple of skimming glances of semi related social media posts sometimes rising to paraphrasing of studies except often done poorly. Responders are very rarely offering links to studies or proper sources of information. This is even before we get to the problem of trolls pretending to be professionals and worse, scumbags who intentionally and maliciously give dangerous advice. No offense folks since we all know the person asking and the vast majority of people answering mean well but this information shortfall from all angles resulting in blind guesswork with more than a small potential for being off the mark is the reality behind the advice going on for these kinds of posts on reddit.*

Now for a short non-commercial break from the heaviness of this topic, ala derp cats https://redd.it/16e9cb1  
...and back to the program...

## Changes to this sub

**Front page posts** - Going forward, this subreddit will be returning to its founding purpose. Front page posts will be limited to ""here's the healthful food I ate"" type image posts. The current added info comment requirement for food image posts will remain in place so participants get ingredient / recipe info as well as macro / micro notes for the food shown. **Text posts will be off the board until enough volunteers have joined the mod team to keep up with them**. 

**The promotion post** - this is going away. The sub will simply no longer allow spam / promotion anywhere in the forum.

**A new weekly pinned info / help request post (starting Monday)** - We don't like people getting confused or angry for wanting help while misunderstanding and being road blocked for it. Therefore, this pinned post will be provided for those who want to ask things here which are food related but are tangential to the sub purpose. These kinds of queries include;

* anything diet oriented - requests for diet analysis, food / drink suggestions, evaluations, ""how much"", ""too much"", ""is this bad for me?"" etc. 
* general nutrition and food category queries - broad food groups like ""dairy"", ""meat"", ""vegetables"", ""melons"", etc. rather than single meal specific
* and for now, anything else that would've been a text post, anything which isn't about a single specific meal with an image of the food shared for discussion
* Note: queries with any context involving a health issue, concern, diagnosis, treatment, etc. will continue to be out of bounds for this sub and will be auto removed (refer to a professional)


We want folks to get their desired info / discussion pertaining to food but we need the sub front page to be clear at a glance what its purpose / topic is so newcomer confusion is kept to a minimum. 

We should have made adjustments when the sub hit major growth, putting topical guardrails in place to prevent the deviation from getting to the level it has. Apologies for that, we've been busy with other mod needs (see below). Taking the steps now to restrict the front page to the sub purpose and adding a weekly (or more frequent) info / help discussion post for food related queries seems to be the best way to get things back on track.

## Moderator help is urgently needed

We have only three active human moderators for a sub of over 3 million subscribers. Because of poorly thought out changes by the site regarding third party apps, our bot help has recently been crippled. For years, we've been way beyond the point of needing more volunteers for the mod team and we're at a breaking point.

Pretty much all our volunteer time is taken up dealing with spammers / scammers. The ratio of spam to legit content here is unusually high compared to other subs. As for the non-spam posts, we simply don't have the eyeball resources to analyze every text post for topical relevance or time to debate it. To open the sub up to other kinds of posts again isn't going to be realistic without bringing additional mod volunteers on board.

Volunteers with moderating experience would be great but we're happy to give pointers to those who are new to it.

Things you need to know if you want to mod: Scammers go to amazing lengths. Bot / AI engagement here is going on much more than you think. People can get to ugly mode fast and some are dangerous. The issues which have to be addressed rarely are just what they seem on the surface so you'll have to enjoy detective work. Site admin support is really bad and claims regarding their efforts tend to prove hollow. Yes, it can get bad like kids pretending to be doctors while intentionally giving malicious advice for funsies or a pervert posting to the person they're stalking their desire to violently hurt the child target (yep, it happened here and site admin refused to help or even talk to us about it). Moderating is not glorious. Shit gets (un)real

16cxhg8,HealthyFood,"Butter, Margarine vs Table spread","Hi all! Really appreciate your professional feedback on this matter.

Throughout my entire life, I’ve been told that butter is healthier compared to Margarine but recently I’ve found out that Butter actually contains higher fat (HDL/LDL) compared to Margarine (80%). 

Now the question is, is this really true? 

Also, looking back at the matter, I discovered the table spreads (not in my home country), which is advertised lower in fat compared to Margarine. 

Again, is this true?

Looking at the ingredients, 99% they say vegetable oil include yet the evidence suggests the so called vegetable oil is the palm oil (which most are saying bad for health). 

Appreciate your support.

Ps. Which one is the healthiest?

Many thanks!",2023-09-08 01:55:05,2024-04-15 01:24:40.289523,219 days 23:29:35.289524,36,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/16cxhg8/butter_margarine_vs_table_spread/

I consume a fair bit of milk directly and by making yogurt. I also enjoy using cream and butter in cooking and eating.

162s54j,HealthyFood,Beet Jerky: any brands or flavors that don’t taste like mulch?,"I’ve been hearing a lot about how nutritious beets are, and that there’s this product called “beet jerky”. Now I love a good food pun (chick’n nuggets anyone?), I love jerky, but I’m not really a beet fan. But if you can turn it into a jerky-like product and flavor it up with pepper or garlic how bad it could be?

So I tried sesame-ginger teriyaki beet jerky. I broke off a small piece, reminded myself it’s not really beef jerky, and ate it. 

I can only describe the flavor and mouthfeel as raked up wet leaves. It was awful. I couldn’t taste sesame, ginger, or teriyaki, just this earthy flavor with beet undertones that required quite a bit of chewing before I could force it down. I couldn’t bring myself to try another bite. 

I wasn’t expecting it to taste like beef jerky but I was hoping it would at least be palatable. 

Again, I’m not really a beet fan so maybe this is impossible, it’s just not for me. But I’m hoping there’s a product out there that isn’t this bad. 

Has anyone found a brand or flavor that you actually enjoy?",2023-08-27 14:40:04,2024-04-15 01:24:40.289605,231 days 10:44:36.289605,20,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/162s54j/beet_jerky_any_brands_or_flavors_that_dont_taste/

It's cheap and easy and feels healthy but I'd really like some pointers of simple things I could add, swap, or remove to improve it.

1x 30oz can veg-all

1x chili meat no beans

There is no singular magic diet for everyone on the planet. People have varying dietary needs / goals depending on physical condition, health issues, age, goals, and dietary and activity history.

Lastly and most important, for those seeking advice here about personal diet (and those trying to sneak in health concerns), proper and accurate advice involves;

* testing to establish current values, tracking over time, and impacts from changes
* examination of medical and family history
* examination of dietary history and activity
* an accredited professional, fully and properly educated, keeping up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. This will always be many times over more accurate and safe than resorting to 1) anonymous strangers who most often are not specialists or educated on the topic 2) people who do not have the proper info to advise you for your specific circumstance and 3) the horrid but realistic possibility that anonymous uninformed sources may either unintentionally or, sadly worse, intentionally give harmful advice

16eexad,HealthyFood,r/HealthyFood subreddit update - Post changes,"Hi,

## The problem

Posts are getting a bit outside the scope of the sub more frequently. These kinds of posts consistently involve critical information gaps by posters and responders. There is also a problem of not having enough moderators for a sub of this size (we'll cover that concern at the end). Therefore, some key changes will be made to this subreddit in order to get things back to center for its topic, focus, and purpose.

The misunderstanding some are having about this sub is like confusing a cat subreddit for a pet subreddit. A cat is a pet but the cat sub is not the right sub for dog questions. We're getting the equivalent of a LOT of dog questions, lizard questions, snake questions, rabbit cage design questions, etc. 

Some people, most often site and sub newcomers, are getting confused and even angry that this sub isn't an anything-ever-possibly-related-to-food sub. 

**What the sub is:** It's for focus on the food itself, specific food, a meal the poster wants to share and get info and opinions on. This sub was founded as a sibling to the food subreddit where posters share food they've had, but here it also focuses on the meal's content and composition, including any ingredient changes made to improve nutritional value, increased or reduced macro / micro values (note the use of *improve*, not *achieved perfection*).

**What the sub is not:** a general nutrition, diet, and health concern consultation forum. The focus needs to get back to being food / specific meal centric, not overarching personal diet, broad food categories, or general nutrition centric.

**You can consult more than one friend / source:** For some questions, another sub may be the better option and that's a good thing. There are several great subreddits which specifically focus on the topic of diet, budget, fitness, general nutrition, and combinations thereof. For example, /r/eatcheapandhealthy and /r/nutrition are great subs related to food and nutrition, each with their own focus, Please add the power of other subs to your info arsenal and enjoy conversing there too with the people who are dedicated to discussing those topics.

*EDIT - Another reason why this sub needs to focus solely on the food and not the person is there is an inherent problem with diet, health concern, and personal context related posts on reddit which is far more concerning than being outside the intent of the sub: The reality is that without these things, which are never provided and would be too personal to do so here, responses are blind guesses that have more than a small possibility of being wrong and can even be dangerous: proper testing, medical history, activity patterns, family history, and an evaluation from an accredited professional who is fully and properly educated in their specialization staying up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. Whereas what happens here is 1) an anonymous person with no accountability will be making wild guesses 2) based on extremely limited and incomplete information provided about the personal scenario and 3) the advice provided tends to be an assessment based on a couple of skimming glances of semi related social media posts sometimes rising to paraphrasing of studies except often done poorly. Responders are very rarely offering links to studies or proper sources of information. This is even before we get to the problem of trolls pretending to be professionals and worse, scumbags who intentionally and maliciously give dangerous advice. No offense folks since we all know the person asking and the vast majority of people answering mean well but this information shortfall from all angles resulting in blind guesswork with more than a small potential for being off the mark is the reality behind the advice going on for these kinds of posts on reddit.*

Now for a short non-commercial break from the heaviness of this topic, ala derp cats https://redd.it/16e9cb1  
...and back to the program...

## Changes to this sub

**Front page posts** - Going forward, this subreddit will be returning to its founding purpose. Front page posts will be limited to ""here's the healthful food I ate"" type image posts. The current added info comment requirement for food image posts will remain in place so participants get ingredient / recipe info as well as macro / micro notes for the food shown. **Text posts will be off the board until enough volunteers have joined the mod team to keep up with them**. 

**The promotion post** - this is going away. The sub will simply no longer allow spam / promotion anywhere in the forum.

**A new weekly pinned info / help request post (starting Monday)** - We don't like people getting confused or angry for wanting help while misunderstanding and being road blocked for it. Therefore, this pinned post will be provided for those who want to ask things here which are food related but are tangential to the sub purpose. These kinds of queries include;

* anything diet oriented - requests for diet analysis, food / drink suggestions, evaluations, ""how much"", ""too much"", ""is this bad for me?"" etc. 
* general nutrition and food category queries - broad food groups like ""dairy"", ""meat"", ""vegetables"", ""melons"", etc. rather than single meal specific
* and for now, anything else that would've been a text post, anything which isn't about a single specific meal with an image of the food shared for discussion
* Note: queries with any context involving a health issue, concern, diagnosis, treatment, etc. will continue to be out of bounds for this sub and will be auto removed (refer to a professional)


We want folks to get their desired info / discussion pertaining to food but we need the sub front page to be clear at a glance what its purpose / topic is so newcomer confusion is kept to a minimum. 

We should have made adjustments when the sub hit major growth, putting topical guardrails in place to prevent the deviation from getting to the level it has. Apologies for that, we've been busy with other mod needs (see below). Taking the steps now to restrict the front page to the sub purpose and adding a weekly (or more frequent) info / help discussion post for food related queries seems to be the best way to get things back on track.

---

## Moderator help is urgently needed

We have only three active human moderators for a sub of over 3 million subscribers. Because of poorly thought out changes by the site regarding third party apps, our bot help has recently been crippled. For years, we've been way beyond the point of needing more volunteers for the mod team and we're at a breaking point.

Pretty much all our volunteer time is taken up dealing with spammers / scammers. The ratio of spam to legit content here is unusually high compared to other subs. As for the non-spam posts, we simply don't have the eyeball resources to analyze every text post for topical relevance or time to debate it. To open the sub up to other kinds of posts again isn't going to be realistic without bringing additional mod volunteers on board.

Volunteers with moderating experience would be great but we're happy to give pointers to those who are new to it.

Things you need to know if you want to mod: Scammers go to amazing lengths. Bot / AI engagement here is going on much more than you think. People can get to ugly mode fast and some are dangerous. The issues which have to be addressed rarely are just what they seem on the surface so you'll have to enjoy detective work. Site admin support is really bad and claims regarding their efforts tend to prove hollow. Yes, it can get bad like kids pretending to be doctors while intentionally giving malicious advice for funsies or a pervert posting to the person they're stalking their desire to violently hurt the child target (yep, it happened here and site admin refused to help or even talk to us about it). Moderating is not glorious. Shit gets (un)real

16cxhg8,HealthyFood,"Butter, Margarine vs Table spread","Hi all! Really appreciate your professional feedback on this matter.

Throughout my entire life, I’ve been told that butter is healthier compared to Margarine but recently I’ve found out that Butter actually contains higher fat (HDL/LDL) compared to Margarine (80%). 

Now the question is, is this really true? 

Also, looking back at the matter, I discovered the table spreads (not in my home country), which is advertised lower in fat compared to Margarine. 

Again, is this true?

Looking at the ingredients, 99% they say vegetable oil include yet the evidence suggests the so called vegetable oil is the palm oil (which most are saying bad for health). 

Appreciate your support.

Ps. Which one is the healthiest?

162s54j,HealthyFood,Beet Jerky: any brands or flavors that don’t taste like mulch?,"I’ve been hearing a lot about how nutritious beets are, and that there’s this product called “beet jerky”. Now I love a good food pun (chick’n nuggets anyone?), I love jerky, but I’m not really a beet fan. But if you can turn it into a jerky-like product and flavor it up with pepper or garlic how bad it could be?

So I tried sesame-ginger teriyaki beet jerky. I broke off a small piece, reminded myself it’s not really beef jerky, and ate it. 

I can only describe the flavor and mouthfeel as raked up wet leaves. It was awful. I couldn’t taste sesame, ginger, or teriyaki, just this earthy flavor with beet undertones that required quite a bit of chewing before I could force it down. I couldn’t bring myself to try another bite.

My blueberries last nearly 2 weeks and my blackberries well over a week without any mold. I wash them and put them in a glass container.  But I'm having problems with raspberries.

1. If I wash them and put them in a glass container, they get really stick/icky and watery. So now I don't wash them.
2. They tend to get pretty moldy if I leave them in their original container in about 5-7 days.

I'm thinking I'll buy less raspberries and eat them first, but I was hoping someone could tell me two things. One, how to wash them so they don't get sticky/icky, and two how do I make them last longer without mold?

15th4pb,HealthyFood,Fruits and veggies Shake,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I’ve recently made a change in my diet where I’ve started drinking my daily intake of fruits and vegetables instead of consuming them in their whole form. This decision was partly due to time constraints and the fact that I didn’t really enjoy eating them in the first place. I’ve been wondering if my body still gets the same nutrients as it would from eating them, logically speaking. What do you think?

Question 1: Do you believe that my body receives the same nutrients when I drink my daily fruits and veggies as it would if I were to eat them?

On a related note, I’ve noticed that my bowel movements have become quite “fluid,” occurring around 2 to 3 times a day and with a very liquid consistency. I attribute this change to the reduced intake of solid foods. However, I’m concerned that this might suggest my body isn’t fully absorbing all the necessary nutrients from the fruits and vegetables, given that they might be passing through my system too quickly.

Question 2: Could the frequent and liquid bowel movements be an indicator that my body isn’t efficiently absorbing the nutrients from the fruits and vegetables due to their speedy passage?

I’m open to any advice or insights you might have regarding this situation. Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and experiences!",2023-08-17 08:20:22,2024-04-15 01:25:34.269806,241 days 17:05:12.269807,19,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/15th4pb/fruits_and_veggies_shake/

I started trying a few things based from the suggestions here:

Great value southwest hot mustard - this is so good with tuna. 10 calories per 5g

Great value Thai sweet chili sauce - also good with tuna.  70 calories per 36g.

I also placed some tuna on salad (Nashville Hot salad from target) and that was also good.

I never got to do it because as soon as I bit down on the strawberry I was blown away by how sweet it was.  Too too sweet! One of my teeth even hurt a little from the shock of it.  I went back to eating my cookie without it.

157kf7y,HealthyFood,A question about the red meat carcinogen study,"Good evening! I was reading about the health of certain foods to educate myself and came across the “red meat is a carcinogen” theory. I feel like it’s often described as a fact but if I read it correctly, it says that “processed meats are a level 1 carcinogen, same as cigarettes” (i find that shocking and hard to believe because either it’s much worse than most people think, or cigarettes are not as bad, or that “level 1” is a bit broad) and that red meat is a “level 2a carcinogen”, and they said that eating an equivalent of 2 slices of bacon per day increases risks by 1%.

Now wait a minute bacon is processed food, and 2a means it’s “probably” a carcinogen and why has over the last years red meat been so bashed if there is “only” one study suggesting that there may be a link? Why aren’t there more studies? I’m not saying that this study is bad but i’m definitely not saying that every study is good, so why isn’t there more evidence on something we’ve been eating since the dawn of time? 

I wanna clarify, I don’t have my opinion made up, I’m genuinely looking for different viewpoints that I may fail to see.

Would highly appreciate if anyone can explain me what I am doing wrong and what the reasons are. 

The only difference I did was using milk (general cow milk - drinking) instead of using plant based one. Was that the reason for the above scenario? 

And yes I mixed them thoroughly.

14k35s0,HealthyFood,"I'm bored of just drinking water, so what else do you drink?","A little bit of context: I'm honestly not a very healthy person and I live a pretty sedentary life, but about a year ago I started trying to at least watch my intake of things like sugar/sodium/etc. I ended up cutting out sodas and really most other drinks entirely, having only bottled or tap water. Now, about a year later, I've tried to branch out and find other drinks that aren't just plain ol' water yet aren't chock full of sugar or some problematic sweetener. I'm back to having a specialty soda or a ginger ale very occasionally; not even because I miss soda, but because I just want something different.

Looking into this kind question already, tons of answers end up suggesting sparkling waters, seltzers, and infused waters. Now normally I'm not a picky eater, but having tried all of these on several occasions, I just don't like them for different reasons. I've also tried kombucha but it sorta turned my stomach, which was a bummer, and I don't know whether or not one should be drinking that constantly due to the bacteria anyway (correct me if I'm wrong, I just don't know). I also tried coconut water a long time ago, and while I didn't like it at the time, I think I'll give it another shot now that I think about it. I've always enjoyed some cold teas or juices, but finding things that I can drink frequently throughout the day without overloading on sugar has been the main challenge.

TL;DR - Aside from water and its spinoffs, what things do you guys like to drink on the regular? Is anyone else picky with sparking/seltz/infused waters but found a kind that you like? Are there any teas or juices you might recommend that don't have a lot of added sugar and such?

Bonus question: Are there any sweeteners you're okay with, or any you'd recommend against having?

13xj8oq,HealthyFood,Why does eating steak make me feel great? Is there a scientific basis behind it?,"I recently noticed that consuming steak leaves me feeling fantastic, and I'm curious to understand the reasons behind it. Despite reducing my meat consumption over the past few months, I decided to indulge in a BBQ and thoroughly enjoyed some steaks. Surprisingly, I felt amazing afterward.

Is this feeling merely psychological or is there a scientific explanation for it? Steak is known to be a rich source of protein, iron, zinc, and various B-vitamins, which are essential for overall health. However, I have been obtaining these nutrients through other sources during my reduced-meat phase. Is there something unique about steak that contributes to this experience?

I would appreciate hearing from those who have experienced similar post-meal sensations after consuming steak. Have you noticed any changes in well-being or energy levels? Is there scientific evidence supporting these effects?

While maintaining a balanced diet and aligning choices with personal health goals is important, exploring the potential health benefits of moderate steak consumption could be worthwhile. Is having a well-prepared steak once a week beneficial in terms of energy, nutrient absorption, or muscle function?

Please share your thoughts, experiences, and any scientific insights you may have on this topic. I'm interested in understanding the potential connection between eating steak and the positive effects it may have on our well-being.",2023-06-01 14:37:04,2024-04-15 01:25:36.641608,318 days 10:48:32.641609,166,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/13xj8oq/why_does_eating_steak_make_me_feel_great_is_there/

13pbpum,HealthyFood,Greek Yogurt in Cookies?? Lengthy Post Ahead,"Yes.. exactly 
I love baking, and typically make my own cookies and brownies so I can bring them to work to eat as a snack. However due my dramatic work schedule change to overnight, I’ve been trying to adjust and baking wasn’t at my interest. 

Now that I’m back into, I was wondering what I can do to change up the recipe to increase the protein and fiber content. 

I’ve made the switch of using regular white flour to Kodiak pancake mix already. But I wanted to change the butter to something else. Don’t tell me about coconut oil. I hate how it completely changes the texture of the cookie. I prefer semi dense and CHEWY cookies 🤤 

So I saw you can substitute butter for Greek yogurt. If using by itself you could do a 1:1 ratio or less. In this instance I used 3/4 cups because greek yogurt is said to add more moisture to the cookies than butter. Additionally I added a cup of blended oats with 2 cups of the pancake mix

At first, when I completely the batter I was concerned because it was liquidity than normal. But the taste was alright, the oat flour threw me off. Right the batter is in the fridge so we’ll see if anything is different

13odhcw,HealthyFood,"Vegan ""Fish"" Tofu (Starring Fish Mint leaves, Nori Seaweed and Black Salt)","Ingredients:

\- 1 cup of Water

\- 1 block of Firm Tofu

\- 1/2 teaspoon Black Salt

\- 2 tablespoons Fish Mint leaves (Houttuynia Cordata)

\- 2 tablespoon Nori powder (or finely crushed nori sheets)

\- 1 tablespoon Tamari (lower sodium brand if possible)

\- 1 teaspoon Garlic powder

\- 1 teaspoon Onion Powder

\- 1/2 teaspoon White Pepper

\- 2 tablespoons Corn Starch (enough to coat)

\- 2 tablespoons Sesame Oil (for Pan-frying)

Instructions:

1.) Press the Tofu to remove excess moisture: Wrap the Tofu block in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, place it in a large plate, and put a heavy object on top (such as a book or a plate with cans). Let it sit for about 15-20 minutes to press out the liquid. Drain and repeat in 5 minute intervals until you think the liquid is mostly removed.

2.) Slice the pressed tofu into thin cubed strips.

\*For more spongey texture, and maximum absorbency while marinating, freeze overnight after slicing and thaw out in the fridge the next day.

3.) When you're ready to move on, use a Mortar and Pestle to finely crush the Fish Mint leaves. Do not attempt to dry cook or dehydrate the leaves for any reason, as Fish Mint loses potency if the oils in the leaf dry out.

4.) In a bowl filled with 1 cup of water, combine the finely crushed Fish Mint leaves, Nori Powder, Black Salt, Tamari, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, and White Pepper. Mix well to create a marinade.

5.) Place the tofu slices in a shallow dish or container and pour the marinade over them. Make sure all sides are coated evenly. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or longer for a stronger fish-like flavor. \*For the strongest flavor, refrigerate the tofu and let it marinate overnight for better results!

6.) After marinating, remove the tofu and transfer it to a plate. Sprinkle Corn starch over the tofu, coating each piece evenly.

\*Before you start cooking, you should consider using the marinade to make a liquid to baste the Tofu as you cook it. You can either strain the marinade as is, or for stronger flavor, just use a Food Processor on high power, then strain it. Boil the marinade medium heat and reduce the marinade to a watery gravy consistency.

7.) Heat Sesame oil in a skillet or frying pan over medium heat.

8.) Carefully place the tofu slices in the pan, making sure not to overcrowd. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden and crispy. While cooking, spoon small amounts of the leftover marinade onto the tofu for added flavor.

9.) Once cooked, remove the tofu from the pan and let it cool on a plate.",2023-05-22 02:13:11,2024-04-15 01:25:36.641795,328 days 23:12:25.641795,3,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/13odhcw/vegan_fish_tofu_starring_fish_mint_leaves_nori/

13ndwi7,HealthyFood,Just wanted to share a few prepped salad tips that have worked for me lately.,"I posted a while ago asking for healthy snack tips, and how to eat more salads without hating my life.. so I want to share the results with you in case you have similar goals.

To eat more salads I bought the large container of pre washed mixed greens. I used to wash them too but I'm trying to be less anal about it and I haven't been washing them if it says pre washed. I've been buying different trail mix bags and leaving them on the counter (even though I hate clutter, but if I have the trail mix on the counter it will remind me to eat that instead of something else, or remind me to make the salad). My favorite hack lately has been pre making the dressing with one of those teeny Tupperwares. I mixed olive oil, balsamic, fresh lemon juice, a little bit of honey, salt, and pepper in a Tupperware. I used it for almost a week and it honestly tasted fine all week after a quick stir.

I prepped a can of chick peas by draining them and rinsing them and storing them in a Tupperware in the fridge. My cheat portion in the salad is the croutons, if you love croutons just sneak a few in or if you have the discipline to refrain from using croutons then your salad would be even healthier ! To prep the chicken I made a week's worth of instant pot chicken breast. I froze one or two and defrosted them as the days went on. I had almost a week's worth of salads with mixed greens, trail mix (cranberries, almonds, seeds, pistachios, etc), chicken, croutons, chick peas, and homemade dressing. I did not take the extra effort to chop additional vegetables for the salad, but maybe some days I will. I have a very large Tupperware that I throw most of the dry ingredients in and then I just stuff the Tupperware of dressing in that same Tupperware and I don't mix the dressing in until I am about to eat the salad.

If you really hate prepping chicken, one day I purchased frozen grilled chicken out of desperation for time that week and to be honest it tasted fine on a salad. Just went in the microwave for a couple of minutes to defrost. If you're vegetarian just substitute chicken with hard boiled eggs. If you're vegan, just skip both and it is still pretty filling.",2023-05-21 00:33:03,2024-04-15 01:25:36.641806,330 days 00:52:33.641806,24,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/13ndwi7/just_wanted_to_share_a_few_prepped_salad_tips/

I was seeing that there are people who are ONLY taking plenny shake and completely replacing their food.... Also, the same company sells the shake in this way, as a MEAL SUBSTITUTE.

Also, your personal opinion, has anyone tried it?

Certainly... it seems miraculous to me, because it is ""cheap"", you don't make a mess, it is faster to ingest and the nutrition seems decent, it brings enough protein.

134fh1o,HealthyFood,Powdered Peanut Butter Preferences,"Powdered Peanut Butter Preferences

Ok so I had been using Crazy Richards PB but because I freaking love PB&J I decided to try out powdered Peanut Butter and Almond Butter. I actually ended up really liking SugarFree PBFit on a PBJ, and prefer it actually because I can make my peanut butter thicker and the sandwich less messy overall. Plus, I find that while the sandwich is still filling, it doesn’t make me feel as heavy afterwards as regular peanut butter. That being said, it’s about time I bought a new container (I’ve just gotten through the first) and I was wondering *for anyone who likes powdered PB* what are your preferences? I’m currently debating between SugarFree PBFit; Original PBFit, PB2 Pure, PB2 Original, and Crazy Richards powered PB - all of which are 60 cals per 2 tbsp, except for the crazy Richards brand which is 50. 

The only reason I don’t want to immediately just go for the crazy Richards brand even though it was the original peanut butter brand I stemmed from and has lower cals is because I can’t buy it in stores around me, so I’d have to buy it online 

Wasn’t sure if there was much of a taste difference between the PBFit SF and original (I think the sugar free is sweet which I know is due to the erythritol) or between PBFit and PB2 (I think I’ve heard most prefer PBFit) and if anyone has had the powdered crazy Richards if it tastes like their regular spread (assuming you’ve had that as well) 

Thanks in advance, wasn’t sure where to post this but 🤷‍♀️",2023-05-01 07:17:19,2024-04-15 01:25:38.054151,349 days 18:08:19.054151,5,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/134fh1o/powdered_peanut_butter_preferences/

133k9o9,HealthyFood,Cook or Toss? Extra processed Tzatziki sauce.,"I was gifted some Tzatziki sauce. I'm trying to lose weight and my first instinct is just to toss it bcz of the extra calories and fat. But I hate wasting food and maybe there's some hidden nutritional benefits I'm not hip to?

If I did keep it, I'd try mixing it with either canned salmon, or my last can of chicken / canned chickpeas, then eat it with white rice. I only have frozen vegetables, and I don't know if they would go well here. Does this sound bad / gross? Those are my only protein options, and my only carb is white rice rn. I do have some dried herbs.

The alternative would be eating those same proteins in a broth soup with frozen veggies and rice. Or eating the salmon with some soy sauce, veggies and rice. If either of these options are markedly healthier than the Tzatziki one, I'll probably just toss unless someone can recommend me a better meal combo. Given how fast it spoils, I'd probably want to use it all up right away.

&#x200B;

Some constraints I'm working with that cannot change:

* I've already tried donating it and no dice
* Cooking for one & I only eat one meal a day & assume my lifestyle is completely sedentary
* Only have access to a microwave and no food processors
* Stuck all my ingredients into the SuperCook website and cannot make any recipes
* Right now I can only purchase the types of canned / dried ingredients you can find in a small dollar store
* I have no fresh meat, produce (besides apples), or most pantry staples. I do not use oil.

132fmuf,HealthyFood,Question on California P65 warning labels on food,"I live in the Midwest (US) and when I cannot recall the last time I saw a California P65  warning on any food in mainstream, US grocery stores like Walmart or Krogers.  

Yet I often see it on imported foods, especially those from China in Asian supermarket, and occasionally on Japanese packaged food too. Usually it warns you about lead or cadmium but when you read the ingredients it all looks normal, nothing artificial.

I wonder why that is. Is it because imported food are truly less safe than US produced food? Or is it because I'm not in California and US food makers only label their products sold in California, whereas foreign food makers have to label everything as they cannot control which states their food end up at? 

So I wonder, have you seen any such labels on US made food? Are they more frequent in California?

I first began trying to get in shape with the goal of ""having a six pack"" immediately after that, and thought running and lifting would get me there. Took a couple years to realize it all started in the kitchen. Then I spent the majority of a year eating a 1200 calorie a day diet, and I did achieve my goals. I actually weighed 135lbs, and was definitely cut like I wanted to be, but I hadn't hit the gym much and lost a lot of muscle. I also couldn't keep that diet up as it was strict, and not to mention 135lbs didn't really seem ""healthy"" either. Even going to the gym was hard because I didn't have the energy to push myself. 

Now, over the last couple years, I've really been focused on just eating healthier and having some self control. I'm not so much trying to get cut anymore and really just want to maintain a healthy life long diet. I actually really like cooking, and instead of forcing myself on a diet I don't like, my new approach has been to find healthier, lower calorie substitutes for foods I actually like. Turkey tacos and burgers, zucchini pastas, homemade low calorie breads and a light meringue crust pizza. A lot of that's been killer and even my non-calorie conscious friends and family members love most of it. One of my favourite tools has been the air fryer. I've been able to get at least decently crispy foods out of it and it's allowed me to add some nice ""fried"" sides to dishes and feel like I'm eating full meals. But I tend to avoid most oils. Just so many different beliefs on which are good and which are bad, and honestly for the most part, I just haven't needed them. But one day I tried making ""fried"" brussel sprouts. It was one of my favorite foods in my go to the gym and running for a six pack phase. Usually they were deep fried which negated any health benefits from the brussel sprouts lol. Unfortunately, they just didn't taste right with out the crispiness they had with deep frying. Honestly, most air fried things lack that extra crispy taste. So I've finally decided I want to find a oil substitute for frying things. I'm not talking deep fried, but instead I'd still be air frying, I'd just like something that I can coat foods with to get to that extra level of crispy and add some of the taste if possible. Every time I look up oil substitutes on Google I get back the same lists of alternative oils, or oil substitutes for baking. So I figured I'd ask y'all. 

Does anyone know of low calorie frying oil substitutes or methods? Please don't suggest other oils and tell me why they are healthier than _____ oil and how just using a little is fine. I understand and appreciate that, but that's just not my goal. 

Thanks in advance.",2023-04-15 15:14:06,2024-04-15 01:25:38.054356,365 days 10:11:32.054357,29,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/12n6vaa/oil_substitute_for_air_frying/

12kqxey,HealthyFood,What gives the crispy texture to cookies?,"Hey everyone

I am making some simple banana oatmeal cookies for my cookie cravings. With little bit of dark chocolate chips they turn out great taste wise. But I am missing the crispy texture of cookies in general and the cookies I make are soft. I am in a weight loss journey so I can only afford 200 k cal for cookies in a day. So I am looking for a way to make them crispier without adding too much calorie to the recipe. The only thing I tried so far is baking them in lower heat for a longer time. That created a harder layer at the outside but inside was still very soft. So I want to learn what are my options or if it is possible without using granulated sugar as I think that's the ingredient that adds crispiness.

My recipe:

50g Oatmeal Flour

1 small banana

15g erythritol

10g dark chocolate chips

Coconut powder

Cinnamon

Salt

It is just smashing bananas with a fork and mixing the rest of the ingredients.

Many people are telling me to cut out or drastically reduce the pasta intake.

I honestly couldn't agree with that because it's unimaginable for me to not have any pasta or dough with my food from time to time, and cutting sugar has better long-term effects for the body and the brain.

Hell, could’ve finished the can and not even noticed, then wondered why the weight wasn’t coming off.

So half the can being 20.5g of sugar, and if I train hard for an average of 2 hours a day, I don’t intake over 25g of carbs (typically, obviously I’m fucked thanks to that Monster today), and I drink lots of water.

How do you make overnight oats a little easier to eat when the wet, soggy, chunky texture puts you off of it?

FULL - 

Hello reddit! I was hoping some fellow redditors in here could provide some tips/advice on preparing overnight oats and making them a little easier to eat for people who have issues with food texture. I tried a recipe for Chocolate Peanut Butter Overnight Oats that I actually LOVED the flavor for, but the actual texture of the oats was almost unbearable. I finished the entire little mason jar I had made, but it was definitely a struggle. I have tried some things like adding some extra toppings like fruits, nuts and some mini chocolate chips, and it sort of helped, but it wasn't enough to fully mask the texture issues. Can the overnight oats be blended? Would that help? I am looking for more of a creamy-like pudding texture, if that's even possible.

It’s a square container and only one side is deformed, so I think she just left it close to the stove. 

Is it still safe to use the butter? I have no idea how long she waited before pouring the butter in, and considering the butter is solid at room temp, it must have still been somewhat warm when she pours it in.

11iuqhq,HealthyFood,Has anyone tried homemade frozen yoghurt?,"From what I've said you essentially freeze yoghurt, wait maybe 30 or so minutes, then whip, then repeat until it's the right consistency, around 2 hours with whipping every 30 minutes. (I don't have an icecream machine)

I had a yoghurt bowl this morning and I found I just didn't like the texture of yoghurt. I shamefully added a handful of sugary cereals along with fruit for the texture. It still wasn't enough.

So by the method mentioned before, if I add stevia (strangely, there's no weird aftertaste with stevia in yog), vanilla extract, cinnamon, etc whatever, to the yoghurt, it'd still have the same nutrients from yoghurt, just a different texture right?

I'm using a full fat greek style natural yoghurt, there's no ingredients on it (?) but looking it up it's just milk so I'm not worried about the sugar from the yoghurt itself (there was like 4.5g/125g i think)

**Mainly I wanted to know if anyone has done this, how it turned out, etc? Or if this is a good idea? Health wise, taste wise, whatever.** It seems genius to me which is why I feel like I'm missing something haha.

Update: I tried it, but I messed up by adding peanut butter and cocoa powder. It was bitter and I did not like it, still gonna have it for breakfast tomorrow. Plain with vanilla n cinnamon was much, muchhh better. Added some chia seeds for a little fiber. Texture wise it was great! Nothing exceptional, but I messed up by not mixing it for an hour after first putting it in the freezer cause I had to do stuff, but after that every 30 mins with a fork and it was fine. Pretty low effort honestly, and it took around 6? or less? idk, 2 minute intervals of stirring. I truly regret the peanut butter and cocoa decision, especially the cocoa. At least peanut butter gives some protein. Definitely going to do this in my hopefully sugar-free Ramadan instead of ice cream haha. It does lose the sweetness the more you freeze so I had to add quite a bit of stevia. I'd recommend! And if you have an ice cream maker all the better.",2023-03-05 11:17:39,2024-04-15 01:25:40.416797,406 days 14:08:01.416797,22,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/11iuqhq/has_anyone_tried_homemade_frozen_yoghurt/

For example replacing ground meat with lentils or beans is often done and argued 'it's ok because lentils are high in protein' - but they are not?

I mean yes, they have less carbs, but for a person who needs lot of calories and protein wouldn't wheat things be a better alternative?",2023-03-03 17:58:40,2024-04-15 01:25:40.416820,408 days 07:27:00.416820,107,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/11h8y1o/why_are_lentils_and_beans_considered_a_good/

But this was really, really good! I just ate it with a fork and dipped the broccoli in the runny yolk sometimes. The egg is crispy and slightly cheesy (I didn't add much) on the bottom and the roasted broccoli was crispy and didn't taste greeny at all with the egg.

I know this isn't some great revelation but as someone trying to incorporate more veggies in my diet I was really pleased. Will hopefully have this again today with more broccoli and eggs, maybe some roasted carrots.

Edit: Forgot to mention no oil used at all for the egg. The crispy cheese made it really easy for the egg to come off and it was easier than when I usually did it with oil since I never used enough.

11amt3v,HealthyFood,Reducing daily consumption of dairy,"Hi,
I am currently consuming quite a lot of dairy products everyday because I like it a lot (😍) and also because I need to eat a lot because of work-outs, it's an easy way to do snacks, breakfast and so on. 
However, I was thinking to reduce my daily dairy products  because I don't think it's that great to eat too much dairy.
I was thinking to use a protein powder as a supplement to replace a part of the dairy. 
Despite the fact that the whey, or casein are the most common protein, I was thinking to use a pea protein powder as it is a slow digest one. 

Do you think that the consumption of dairy proteins (whey etc) is considered as a proper dairy product because we can often read that proteins from dairy can be harmful in too large quantitieswbut beneficial in moderate amount. 

Do you have any advices on this subject please?",2023-02-24 08:52:18,2024-04-15 01:25:40.416980,415 days 16:33:22.416981,29,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/11amt3v/reducing_daily_consumption_of_dairy/

115blb6,HealthyFood,"How much electrolytes should I consume if I am sweating in the sauna profusely for 30 minutes, and I desire to drink 1500ml of water?","This is a question of what maximum amount of electrolytes are healthy, and how much should I offset the quantity of water I drink.

On an average day, I work out in the gym for 90 minutes prior to going into the sauna. I drink about 20 oz of water during my workout. Then I will go into the sauna for 30 minutes. Rest. Then go back in for another 15 minutes. I sweat profusely in the sauna.

&#x200B;

Here is the electrolyte powder I use: 

Supplement Facts  
Serving Size 1 scoop (3g)  
Amount Per Serving %DV  
Calcium (as Calcium Lactate) 38mg 3%  
Magnesium (as Magnesium Citrate) 60mg 14%  
Chloride (from Sea Salt) 9mg <1%  
Sodium (from Sea Salt) 5mg <1%  
Potassium (as Potassium Citrate) 500mg 11%  
Conce TraceR AC (Trace Mineral Complex) 50mg  
""Daily Value (DV) not established.  
Other Ingredients: Citric acid anhydrous, natural  
flavors, malic acid, steviol glycosides. 

I take the directions with a grain of salt (pun-intended), but they say to mix one scoop with 240ml of water and follow with ""plenty of fluids."" I tend to have 6 scoops total throughout my sauna sessions. 

&#x200B;

If you can figure it out from there, that's great. But if not, here's some extra factors to consider perhaps

	• I am an adult male at 150lbs

	• The rate of sweat in the sauna (90 degrees Celsius sauna)

	• 1500ml of water is perhaps too much to drink within an hour of sauna time, despite that being desired on average from my body

	• Are the contents of the electrolyte powder complete enough? I've used other ones, but this one is well-priced for me

	• Average daily potassium intake for American male is at 3,016mg. Does this mean I should only have 3.5 scoops of electrolyte powder total to be at adequate amount of potassium intake of 4,700mg?

	• I don't eat fast food, but the average American sodium intake is already above daily recommendation levels

	• If my electrolyte powder is bad, what type of ingredient list would be better to look for?

I won't stop as it saves me plenty of money. I was wondering how healthy is this? What are the effects?

Updates:
THANK YOU ALL! So far from you have all given me these are a dot points of how to somewhat manage a diet whilst working.

Ingredients for pizza
- plenty of veg
- no cured meats such as sausage or prosciutto
- protein such as chicken
- reduce fats in general
- use sauces that have little salt or sugar in it
- pizza dough is filled with empty carbs which can cause much weight
- sometimes the actual protein and important things sometimes are little to known at fast food places.
- There will be little to none vitamins being gain from pizza or the toppings

Making and eating
- when making a pizza opt for a thinner crust
- majority should be veg
- do not have salty meals with soda and sugary drinks, real juices and water are much better
- SALADS: Pizza places may not have salads on the menu but as worker and especially if your a chef there is no reason to not swap pizza for salads. There are so many toppings which can be used to create a half decent salad. 

Outside of Work life
- All those empty carbs can creep up and create weight gain, to manage thus making sure to be active such as the gym or playing sport to burn off those excess calories
- Regain those vitamins you are missing out on",2023-02-17 23:57:03,2024-04-15 01:25:40.417164,422 days 01:28:37.417164,100,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/1151ib0/effects_of_a_heavy_carb_based_diet/

It's the opposite, really. My stomach feels light, like I could go for a jog immediately after without any discomfort. Before the oats, I either ate til I felt full and then felt horrible or ate very light and felt hungry / horrible. 

I'm looking for something similar to eat in the early afternoon. Ideally, I'd like something full of different nutrients. Maybe something that had some mushrooms and ""superfoods"" in it.

i can tolerate a lot of protein bars- i’m not expecting something insanely delicious. i really like rx bars, quest hero, pure protein, barebells, nicks, think! etc so i’m very open to a lot. however i hate the regular quest bars and no cow so if kirkland taste anything like those it’s a big no from me lol.",2023-02-06 18:17:42,2024-04-15 01:25:41.642426,433 days 07:07:59.642426,42,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/10vdquv/kirkland_protein_bars/
10v79ph,HealthyFood,How healthy are cheese omelettes?,"So I mostly make a parmesan & sharp cheddar omelettes for breakfast every morning. 

The omelette consists of these ingredients. I don’t normally measure my ingredients, I just eye it out. 

- 2 eggs
- heavy whipping cream 
- diced onions 
- diced cherry tomatoes 
- cubbed Ham (sometimes)
- and roughly a cup or a little over of parmesan and sharp cheddar cheese. 

Is it healthy to eat that much cheese daily? I’ll even make this for my dinner when I get home from work. 

I’ve been gaining back some weight lately but I believe that has to do with the sweets I’ve been eating, but is this omelet dish also causing me weight gain?",2023-02-06 13:59:15,2024-04-15 01:25:41.642431,433 days 11:26:26.642431,149,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/10v79ph/how_healthy_are_cheese_omelettes/
10v34qx,HealthyFood,Blueberry Smoothie,"Hello, I am generally active and fit, my corrent goal with food is to get enough protein, eat a variety and keep a slight caloric deficit.

lately I heard about the many benfits of consuming blueberries daily, so I started to consume them.

I found out that buying fresh, could be almost 5 times more expensive than frozen. so I decided to buy frozen blueberries and blend them into a shake every two days roughly.

the smoothie include:

* handfull of blueberries
* milk/high protein soy milk
* sometime I add a single date
* sometimg I add protein powder

My machine is the: ""Ninja SS101 Foodi Smoothie Maker & Nutrient Extractor""

it has many settings like: ""EXTRACT"", ""SMOOTHIE"", "" SPREAD"" and ""BOAL"". i don't really understand them so I only set it to SMOOTHIE.

(the smoothie is usually high protein since I workout alot) everytime I make a smoothie I drink all of it right away, I really like and enjoy the smoothie, even more than eating the blueberries raw.

The problem is I heard that I lose many health benefits because I mix the blueberries into a smoothie. cells are being cut in the blender and some fibers are destroyed, addtionally, I heard that after blending, the exposure to oxygen cause some neutrients to escape, although I drink it right away so I guess it doesn't matter that much.

My Question Is:

What Is really lost when I blend the blueberries, health wise (do I lose vitamin E?, Antioxidants? etc) and if that lost is significant or negligible.

additionally, would you recommed to continue making those smoothies? would you suggest changing my recipe? what would you do? (assming we had the same health goals)",2023-02-06 10:12:57,2024-04-15 01:25:41.642438,433 days 15:12:44.642439,16,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/10v34qx/blueberry_smoothie/

Original Recipe

RICH ROLL COOKIES

Cream:
1 cup butter and 2/3 cup sugar

Beat in:
1 egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract

2 1/2 cups sifted flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt (if using unsalted butter)

10pm0g7,HealthyFood,Help with Golden Milk!!,"Okay, hopefully, I can FINALLY get this to post ***somewhere!!***

Anyways, I found a recipe online for making Golden Milk. It was something like:

1. 1tsp turmeric
2. 1tsp cinnamon
3. 2tsp local raw honey
4. 2-pinches of ground black, white, and red pepper
5. 1tsp of ground ginger
6. 1cup of A2 whole milk 

According to the recipe, this would be 2 servings. 

It said to mix ingredients and bring it to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Okay, so I did all of that; great! Now the issue... no matter *what* I tried to strain this through - I did not have cheesecloth, so that isn't something I was able to try - it would ***not*** strain. And I mean **at all!** I tried using a wet coffee filter - NOPE, it didn't work, and in fact, it was the only thing that didn't even allow a drop of liquid through! Next, I tried using a wet napkin. Again, this did not work! However, I did get a couple of drops through before it invariably stopped dripping (I even tried using a spoon to sort of pull away any of the ""clumps"" from the seasonings). The only other thing I had that I could try was a washcloth. I figured since washcloths are very porous, this would work, but because of how porous it was, I expected some of the 'seasonings' to get through into the drink, but this didn't work either!! In the end, I put a couple of wet coffee filters under the rag and sort of gently squeezed them to get what little liquid I could get from this. I ended up with less than 1/4 of a cup! 

So, my question is for anyone that has made this drink before - obviously, it may not be the exact same recipe I used as there are a crazy number of different recipes for this out there - how the hell did you manage to actually strain this so you could get more than a few drops out of the final product? I'd like to make it again, as what little I managed to get tasted pretty good, and the health benefits are pretty substantial, but there is no way I will make it again if I cannot even strain the crap! 

I want to go ahead and thank anyone that provides a solution to this problem for their time and assistance. (I also spent a long time trying to find a solution to this prior to making a post, but 99% of what I got were just damned recipes for golden milk!

I have some food aversions, and quite a few leftovers are really hard for me to eat without my brain actively telling me that it's gross (even if objectively I'm enjoying the food- i.e. it tastes good, it feels good, etc, my brain will override and make me gag if it's a food that's been assigned the ""gross"" label in my brain. I'm not sure how to change this. Things like pasta or soup leftovers are not allowed in my brain.)

I make a killer soup but the prep makes it hard for me to want to make it instead of defaulting to shitty fast food. I thought about maybe taking a day to chop veggies and stuff then freezing it so I can make a soup by just throwing stuff in a pot could be good, but I'm not sure how to go about that- could that ruin the vegetables? do things like carrots, potatoes, etc freeze okay?

What are other meals that could be easy to prepare for when I want to throw everything together? I feel like chicken could be good- I sometimes will like cut some chicken and put it in individual baggies so i don't have to defrost a whole pack. That's been useful.

I'm sure the more I make cooking part of my routine the less of an issue this will be, but in the meantime I'm floundering with my health attempts.

Does it mean no highly processed food? Processed food? Greasy food? Fried food? Chain foods? 
I’ve tried doing quick google searches only to fail but I would really like some guidance from those who may be aware. 

I think as a whole I would like to avoid places or chains such as quick 2 minute foods with drive thrus but any input is greatly appreciated.

103i40l,HealthyFood,How to stick to your 23’ healthy eating resolutions!,"Here’s simple yet effective tips to make your resolutions a lasting lifestyle. 

1. DRINK MORE WATER. When you wake up, when you want a snack, when you’re not sure if you’re actually hungry or bored. Due to primitive survival instincts our minds have a hard time distinguishing between hunger and thirst. There’s nothing healthier than water!!!

2. WILL POWER DOESNT WORK. You know who has the strongest will power ? - the people who avoid it. Don’t buy a pint of Ben and Jerry’s if you know you’ll eat it in one day. Don’t keep junk food in the house if you can’t help but binge. If I need ice cream, I buy an ice cream bar (not a tub) Know yourself, work with yourself, avoid having to use “will power”

3. AVOID PROCESSED FOODS! Is it full of preservatives? Is it ten steps away from something that grows in nature? Stay away!!! You can still be a lazy or cheap eater and keep it natural. Try nuts, eggs, canned or jarred foods. Find inspiration at your local farmers market. Check ingredients!!

4. FIND YOUR FAVORITE SEASONINGS. You don’t need to be a good cook if you have good seasoning. My favorite is Everything But The Bagel seasoning from Trader Joe’s. I put it on everything.

5. FIND JOY IN EATING HEALTHY. Make colorful dishes, thank yourself before every meal, splurge on a water bottle you love. For example, I made my morning smoothie my daily ritual. It is part of my meditation each day. I associate my healthy habit with self love!!

Good luck on your healthy food journey in 2023 everyone :)",2023-01-04 23:04:16,2024-04-15 01:25:42.349553,466 days 02:21:26.349553,72,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/103i40l/how_to_stick_to_your_23_healthy_eating_resolutions/

Currently no time to prepare my own food... Due to time management issues and , over hours so counting on what the factory serves at lunch.

Its like a Shawarma/Doner kebab rotisserie... Meat type changes between Turkey/Beef/Veal/Chicken...

I'm assuming it can be very unhealthy with so called ""Empty carbs"" Pita bread/Tortilla lots of added extra animal fat ,and various sauces...

So the plan was to eliminate all Processed empty carbs like Pita bread/Tortilla , and sauces and skip the extra added fat.

So basically Meat as lean as possible , Vegetables (Pickles ,  Cauliflower ,Cabbage, tomatoes, onions , garlic etc). And some 100% Sesame Tahini, a little here and there...

vecnwn,HealthyFood,Managed to kick all processed sugar out of my diet…the result,"Drinking my coffee black, no more cereal, now it’s steel cut oatmeal with just a small bit of raw, pure honey. No more desserts, milk, etc.

I cut back drastically on sugar a few months ago now have completely cut it out. I’m sort of amazed at the results on my taste buds.

Without all that sugar constantly bombarding my pallet I feel like my taste receptors have sort of reset themselves. All fruit is tasting absolutely amazing now. Strawberries are no longer too tart. Heck, I’ve even started eating grapefruit and now really like the flavor. Right now an orange is my dessert and I absolutely look forward to it. It’s like eating candy. It tastes delicious.

I’ve also sort of started to embrace the more natural flavors of bitter and tart. I now like the taste of black coffee. It has a nice nutty, acidic, sweet yet bitter taste. 

I feel like I’m finally able to sense how food is suppose to taste. My food is requiring less salt too to taste good. I’m enjoying the raw, more natural flavors of things way more.

Like last night’s dinner: red, yellow, orange pepper slices and pork cubes sautéed with garlic, onion, ginger, turmeric, cayenne pepper, paprika over brown rice. Used much less salt than I normally did and absolutely loved the flavors.

EDIT: I’ve always loved to cook and absolutely love grocery shopping. I guess that helps.

I also stopped drinking 6 months ago and have put myself on a steady exercise routine of cardio, strength training and stretching/yoga. Before this as a middle age male I was way over my ideal weight, my joints/knees hurt constantly, bad sleep, etc. 

I’ve lost 30lbs so far, my joints/knees have stopped hurting, I have way more energy for my children, my memory has improved, I’m more alert. I just feel so much better.

EDIT 2: This was a long, slow process. I didn't go cold turkey. It took 6 months, carefully eliminating 1 thing at a time, adding in healthy options. The first (and hardest) was the alcohol.",2022-06-17 13:01:45,2024-04-15 01:25:01.321536,667 days 12:23:16.321536,224,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/vecnwn/managed_to_kick_all_processed_sugar_out_of_my/

102eex2,HealthyFood,"Eating healthy food is easy, giving up unhealthy food is hard","I (M26) have been blessed with a metabolism and GI track that can handle pretty much anything I throw at it (except lettuce ironically). I’ve never struggled with adverse effects of eating what I want, when I want it. For the past year though, I’ve been working hard to eat healthy alternatives. Choosing minimally processed foods, dodging PUFAs like Mike Tyson, and eating more fruits and veggies. 

My hope was that as I did this, it would become easy to just give up fast food all together. Turns out, that’s not what happened. I still get hammered with cravings for a Wendy’s burger, or Bojangles fries, or a Popeyes crispy spicy sandwich. It’s pretty much a daily thing and while I have learned not to pull into that drive through, I still feel such a powerful craving for it. 

You may think this has to do with dietary issues, maybe something I’m leaving out of my nutrient profile. I really don’t think this is the case though, because I feel full. I’m not low carb or low fat, certainly not low sodium. Just eating normal non-fast food. Yet the desire for objectively nasty food persists. Two years ago I never would have guessed it would be so hard, but now I know differently.",2023-01-03 17:50:09,2024-04-15 01:25:10.719428,467 days 07:35:01.719428,90,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/102eex2/eating_healthy_food_is_easy_giving_up_unhealthy/

12b9b7w,HealthyFood,My wife and I have been eating healthy food for the past month and it's really depressing me.,"We're trying to reduce caloric intake and lower our sodium consumption.  My wife is doing OK snacking on yogurt and granola, baked salt-free vegetable chips and rice cakes etc. but I cannot *stand* any of that stuff and would rather do without than eat it.  

About the only healthy food I enjoy is fresh fruit, but I still crave salty, savory snack foods very much.  Every now and then I will roast some salt-free spicy sunflower seeds for myself,  but that's kind of a big chore.  

Maybe I will live longer from this diet, or maybe it will just feel that way, because I really, really miss tasty, substantial snacks like salted nuts, potato chips, salami sandwiches, etc.

What are some substantial healthy savory snacks that satisfy you and don't have the bleak, depressing flavor and texture of styrofoam packing chips and cardboard?",2023-04-04 04:49:58,2024-04-15 01:25:11.734914,376 days 20:35:13.734914,387,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/12b9b7w/my_wife_and_i_have_been_eating_healthy_food_for/
